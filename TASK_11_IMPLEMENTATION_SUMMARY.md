- **GET /admin/api/system-health** - Get system health status with component-level health checks

#### 3. User Management API
- **GET /admin/api/users/<user_id>/jobs** - Get all jobs for a specific user with detailed job information
- **PUT /admin/api/users/<user_id>/limits** - Update job limits and quotas for a specific user
- **GET /admin/api/users/<user_id>/limits** - Get current job limits for a specific user

#### 4. Configuration Management API
- **GET /admin/api/config** - Get current system configuration including rate limits and maintenance settings
- **PUT /admin/api/config** - Update system configuration with validation and audit logging

#### 5. Alert Management API
- **GET /admin/api/alerts** - Get all active system alerts with detailed information
- **POST /admin/api/alerts/<alert_id>/acknowledge** - Acknowledge a specific alert with admin tracking

- ✅ Detailed error messages and logging
- ✅ Graceful degradation on service failures

#### Input Validation
- ✅ JSON request validation
- ✅ Parameter type checking and range validation
- ✅ Required field validation
- ✅ Data sanitization and length limits

#### Integration
- ✅ Seamless integration with existing admin services:
  - AdminManagementService
  - MultiTenantControlService  
  - WebCaptionGenerationService
  - SystemMonitor
  - AlertManager
- ✅ Proper database session management
- ✅ Redis session integration

#### Response Format

- ✅ Success/error status indicators
- ✅ Detailed error messages
- ✅ Proper HTTP status codes
- ✅ Structured data responses

### Code Quality
- ✅ Comprehensive logging with appropriate log levels
- ✅ Clear function documentation
- ✅ Consistent error handling patterns
- ✅ Proper resource cleanup
- ✅ Type hints and validation

### Requirements Satisfied
All requirements from task 11 have been fully implemented:

- **3.1** - Admin dashboard visibility ✅
- **3.3** - Detailed job information and management ✅  
- **4.1** - Admin job cancellation capabilities ✅
- **4.2** - User job management and oversight ✅
- **5.1** - System-wide configuration management ✅
- **5.2** - User limit and quota management ✅
- **6.1** - Alert management and acknowledgment ✅

### Testing

- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Next Steps
The admin API endpoints are now ready for use. Administrators can:

1. Monitor and manage caption generation jobs across all users
2. View detailed system metrics and health status
3. Configure user limits and system settings
4. Manage system alerts and notifications
5. Access comprehensive audit trails for all admin actions

The implementation provides a robust foundation for multi-tenant caption management with enterprise-grade security and monitoring capabilities.
