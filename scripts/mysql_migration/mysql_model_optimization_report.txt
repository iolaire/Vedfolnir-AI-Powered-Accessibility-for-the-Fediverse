ðŸ“‹ OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:

MySQL Model Performance Recommendations:

1. INDEX OPTIMIZATION:
   - Use composite indexes for multi-column WHERE clauses
   - Limit index key length to 767 bytes (191 chars for utf8mb4)
   - Use covering indexes for frequently accessed columns
   - Consider partial indexes for large text columns

2. DATA TYPE OPTIMIZATION:
   - Use VARCHAR(255) instead of VARCHAR(500+) for indexed columns
   - Use TEXT for large content that doesn't need indexing
   - Use ENUM for fixed sets of values (better than VARCHAR)
   - Use proper integer sizes (TINYINT, SMALLINT, INT, BIGINT)

3. FOREIGN KEY OPTIMIZATION:
   - Always specify ON DELETE CASCADE/SET NULL for referential integrity
   - Use consistent data types for foreign key relationships
   - Index foreign key columns for join performance

4. TABLE OPTIMIZATION:
   - Use InnoDB engine for ACID compliance and foreign keys
   - Set ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC for variable-length columns
   - Use utf8mb4 charset for full Unicode support
   - Consider partitioning for very large tables

5. QUERY OPTIMIZATION:
   - Use lazy='select' for relationships to avoid N+1 queries
   - Implement proper pagination for large result sets
   - Use bulk operations for multiple inserts/updates
   - Consider read replicas for read-heavy workloads

6. MONITORING AND MAINTENANCE:
   - Monitor slow query log for optimization opportunities
   - Use EXPLAIN to analyze query execution plans
   - Regular ANALYZE TABLE to update statistics
   - Monitor index usage and remove unused indexes
