## Technical Implementation Details

### Notification Handler Architecture

```python
class AdminUserManagementNotificationHandler:
    - notify_user_created()      # User creation notifications
    - notify_user_updated()      # User update notifications with change tracking
    - notify_user_deleted()      # User deletion notifications with reasons
    - notify_user_role_changed() # Role change notifications with security validation
    - notify_user_status_changed() # Status change notifications
    - notify_user_password_reset() # Password reset notifications
    - notify_bulk_user_operation() # Bulk operation summary notifications
```

### Integration Service

```python
class AdminUserManagementIntegration:
    - initialize_app_integration() # Flask app registration
    - get_notification_handler()   # Handler access
    - get_integration_status()     # Status monitoring
```

### Operation Context Tracking

```python
@dataclass
class UserOperationContext:
    operation_type: str      # Type of operation performed
    target_user_id: int      # ID of user being operated on
    target_username: str     # Username of target user
    admin_user_id: int       # ID of admin performing operation
    admin_username: str      # Username of admin
    ip_address: str          # IP address of admin
    user_agent: str          # Browser/client information
    additional_data: dict    # Optional additional context
```

## Route Integration Examples

### User Creation with Notifications

```python
@bp.route('/users/add', methods=['POST'])
def add_user():
    # ... user creation logic ...
    
    if success and user_data:
        # Send real-time notification to admins
        notification_handler = get_notification_handler()
        if notification_handler:
            context = create_operation_context(
                user_data['id'], 
                user_data['username'], 
                'user_created'
            )
            notification_handler.notify_user_created(context, user_data)
```

### Role Change with Security Validation

```python
@bp.route('/users/role/update', methods=['POST'])
def update_user_role():
    # ... role update logic ...
    
    if success:
        # Send real-time notification to admins
        if notification_handler:
            context = create_operation_context(
                int(user_id), 
                target_username, 
                'user_role_changed'
            )
            notification_handler.notify_user_role_changed(
                context, old_role, new_role_enum, reason
            )
```
