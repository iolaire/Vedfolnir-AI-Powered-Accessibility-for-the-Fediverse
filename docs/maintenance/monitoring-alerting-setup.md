# Enhanced Maintenance Mode - Monitoring and Alerting Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for setting up monitoring and alerting systems for the Enhanced Maintenance Mode system. It covers monitoring infrastructure, alert configuration, dashboard setup, and integration with external monitoring systems.

## Monitoring Architecture

### Components Overview

The monitoring system consists of several layers:

1. **System Level**: CPU, memory, disk, network monitoring
2. **Application Level**: Response times, error rates, maintenance status
3. **Database Level**: Connection pools, query performance, data integrity
4. **Redis Level**: Memory usage, session counts, performance metrics
5. **Business Level**: Maintenance events, user impact, operational metrics

### Monitoring Layers

- **Health Checks**: Continuous system health validation
- **Metrics Collection**: Performance and resource metrics
- **Alert Manager**: Intelligent alerting with configurable thresholds
- **Dashboard**: Real-time visualization and status display
- **External Integration**: Prometheus, Grafana, and other monitoring tools

## System Monitoring Setup

### Health Check System

Create comprehensive health check scripts that monitor all system components:

- Application health endpoints
- Database connectivity and performance
- Redis connectivity and memory usage
- System resource utilization
- Maintenance mode status

### Metrics Collection

Implement continuous metrics collection for:

- System resources (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Application performance (response times, error rates)
- Database metrics (connections, query performance)
- Redis metrics (memory usage, session counts)
- Maintenance mode events and statistics

### Cron Job Configuration

Set up automated monitoring tasks:

```bash
# Health checks every 5 minutes
*/5 * * * * /opt/vedfolnir/monitoring/health_check.py

# Metrics collection every minute
* * * * * /opt/vedfolnir/monitoring/system_monitor.py

# Alert processing every 5 minutes
*/5 * * * * /opt/vedfolnir/monitoring/alert_manager.py
```

## Alert Manager Setup

### Email Alerting

Configure email alerts for:

- Critical system failures
- High resource usage
- Maintenance mode events
- Security incidents
- Performance degradation

### Alert Thresholds

Set appropriate thresholds for:

- CPU usage: Warning at 80%, Critical at 95%
- Memory usage: Warning at 85%, Critical at 95%
- Disk usage: Warning at 90%, Critical at 95%
- Response times: Warning at 2s, Critical at 5s

### Alert Cooldown

Implement cooldown periods to prevent alert spam:

- Default cooldown: 15 minutes
- Critical alerts: 5 minutes
- Warning alerts: 30 minutes

## Dashboard Setup

### Web Dashboard

Create a simple web dashboard that displays:

- System health status
- Resource utilization
- Maintenance mode status
- Recent alerts and events
- Performance metrics

### Real-time Updates

Implement automatic refresh and real-time updates:

- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- WebSocket connections for real-time data
- Status indicators with color coding
- Historical trend visualization

## Integration with External Monitoring

### Prometheus Integration

Export metrics to Prometheus:

- System metrics (CPU, memory, disk)
- Application metrics (response times, errors)
- Custom maintenance mode metrics
- Health check results

### Grafana Dashboard

Create Grafana dashboards for:

- System overview
- Application performance
- Maintenance mode tracking
- Alert history and trends

## Testing and Validation

### Test Procedures

Regularly test the monitoring system:

1. **Health Check Testing**: Verify all health checks work correctly
2. **Alert Testing**: Test alert delivery mechanisms
3. **Dashboard Testing**: Verify dashboard displays correct information
4. **Load Testing**: Test monitoring under high system load

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] All monitoring scripts executable and working
- [ ] Cron jobs configured and running
- [ ] Email alerts configured and tested
- [ ] Dashboard accessible and displaying data
- [ ] External integrations working (if configured)

## Maintenance and Troubleshooting

### Regular Maintenance

- **Daily**: Review alert logs and dashboard
- **Weekly**: Test alert mechanisms and rotate logs
- **Monthly**: Review thresholds and update configurations

### Common Issues

1. **Scripts Not Running**: Check cron configuration and permissions
2. **Alerts Not Sent**: Verify email configuration and SMTP settings
3. **Dashboard Issues**: Check service status and logs
4. **Missing Data**: Verify data collection scripts and file permissions

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

- Restrict dashboard access to authorized users
- Secure alert delivery mechanisms
- Protect monitoring data and logs
- Use encrypted connections where possible

### Data Privacy

- Avoid logging sensitive information
- Implement log retention policies
- Secure monitoring data storage
- Regular security audits of monitoring system

## Conclusion

This monitoring and alerting setup provides comprehensive visibility into the Enhanced Maintenance Mode system. The combination of health checks, metrics collection, alerting, and dashboards ensures that administrators can proactively manage the system and respond quickly to any issues.

Key benefits:
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Early detection of potential issues
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All system components monitored
- **Intelligent Alerting**: Reduces false positives and alert fatigue
- **Real-time Visibility**: Immediate insight into system status
- **External Integration**: Works with existing monitoring infrastructure
