# Enhanced Maintenance Mode - User Guide

## Overview

The Enhanced Maintenance Mode system provides comprehensive protection during system maintenance operations. This guide explains how to use the maintenance mode features from a user perspective.

## What is Maintenance Mode?

Maintenance mode is a system state that temporarily restricts certain operations to ensure system stability during maintenance procedures. When maintenance mode is active:

- **Blocked Operations**: Certain high-risk operations are temporarily unavailable
- **Admin Access**: System administrators retain full access to manage the system
- **User Communication**: Clear messages inform users about maintenance status and expected duration
- **Graceful Handling**: Running operations are allowed to complete safely

## Maintenance Mode Types

### Normal Maintenance Mode
- **Purpose**: Routine maintenance and updates
- **Behavior**: Blocks new operations while allowing existing ones to complete
- **User Impact**: Limited - users can still browse and view content
- **Duration**: Typically planned with advance notice

### Emergency Maintenance Mode
- **Purpose**: Critical system issues requiring immediate protection
- **Behavior**: Immediately blocks all non-admin operations
- **User Impact**: Significant - only administrators can access the system
- **Duration**: Until the emergency is resolved

### Test Maintenance Mode
- **Purpose**: Testing maintenance procedures without affecting operations
- **Behavior**: Simulates blocking behavior without actual restrictions
- **User Impact**: None - normal operations continue
- **Duration**: Used for validation and training
