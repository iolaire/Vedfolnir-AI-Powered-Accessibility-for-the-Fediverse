# Session Closed Events Fix

## Problem
The webapp.log was showing excessive "Session created" and "Session closed" events for every HTTP request, including static file requests (CSS, JS, images, favicons). This was causing unnecessary database session overhead and log noise.

## Root Cause
Two middleware components were creating database sessions for ALL requests:

1. **SessionPerformanceMonitor** - Was monitoring and creating sessions for every request
2. **DatabaseContextMiddleware** - Was initializing database sessions for every request

Static file requests (served by Flask's built-in static file handler) don't need database access, so creating sessions for them was wasteful.

## Solution
Added static file exclusion checks in both middleware components:

### 1. SessionPerformanceMonitor (`session_performance_monitor.py`)
```python
@app.before_request
def start_performance_monitoring():
    # Skip monitoring for static files
    if request.endpoint == 'static':
        return
    # ... rest of monitoring code

@app.teardown_request  
def end_performance_monitoring(exception=None):
    # Skip monitoring for static files
    if request.endpoint == 'static':
        return
    # ... rest of monitoring code
```

### 2. DatabaseContextMiddleware (`database_context_middleware.py`)
```python
@self.app.before_request
def before_request():
    # Skip database session creation for static files
    if request.endpoint == 'static':
        return
    # ... rest of session creation code

@self.app.teardown_request
def teardown_request(exception=None):
    # Skip database session cleanup for static files  
    if request.endpoint == 'static':
        return
    # ... rest of session cleanup code

@self.app.context_processor
def inject_session_aware_objects():
    # Skip template context injection for static files
    if request.endpoint == 'static':
        return {}
    # ... rest of context injection code
```

## Benefits
- **Reduced Log Noise**: No more session creation/closure messages for static files
- **Better Performance**: No unnecessary database session overhead for static assets
- **Cleaner Monitoring**: Session metrics now only track actual application requests
- **Resource Efficiency**: Database connection pool is not wasted on static files

## Testing
Use the provided test script to verify the fix:
```bash
python test_static_session_fix.py
```

Then check `webapp.log` to confirm that static file requests no longer generate session events.

## Files Modified
- `session_performance_monitor.py` - Added static file exclusion in monitoring hooks
- `database_context_middleware.py` - Added static file exclusion in session management hooks

## Configuration
The fix uses Flask's built-in `request.endpoint` to identify static file requests. No additional configuration is needed.
