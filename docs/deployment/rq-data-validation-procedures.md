# RQ Data Validation and Verification Procedures

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive data validation and verification procedures for the Redis Queue (RQ) migration. These procedures ensure data integrity, consistency, and completeness throughout the migration process.

## Data Validation Framework

### Validation Levels

1. **Pre-Migration Validation**: Baseline data integrity checks
2. **Migration Validation**: Real-time data consistency during migration
3. **Post-Migration Validation**: Comprehensive verification after migration
4. **Ongoing Validation**: Continuous monitoring and validation

### Data Integrity Principles

- **Completeness**: All data is migrated without loss
- **Consistency**: Data relationships are maintained
- **Accuracy**: Data values are preserved correctly
- **Timeliness**: Migration timestamps are accurate
- **Auditability**: All changes are logged and traceable

## Validation Scripts

The validation framework includes comprehensive scripts for:
- Pre-migration data snapshots
- Data quality assessment
- Migration monitoring
- Task integrity validation
- Post-migration system validation
- Continuous monitoring
- Automated validation pipelines
- Validation reporting

## Usage Instructions

### Pre-Migration Validation
```bash
# Create data snapshot
python scripts/validation/pre_migration_snapshot.py

# Assess data quality
python scripts/validation/assess_data_quality.py
```

### Migration Validation
```bash
# Monitor migration progress
python scripts/validation/monitor_migration.py 60  # 60 minutes

# Validate task integrity
python scripts/validation/validate_task_integrity.py
```

### Post-Migration Validation
```bash
# Comprehensive system validation
python scripts/validation/post_migration_validation.py

# Run validation pipeline
python scripts/validation/run_validation_pipeline.py post_migration
```

### Ongoing Validation
```bash
# Continuous monitoring (once)
python scripts/validation/continuous_monitoring.py once

# Generate validation report
python scripts/validation/generate_validation_report.py 7  # Last 7 days
```

## Validation Schedule

Automated validation should be scheduled using cron:

```bash
# Daily integrity checks
0 2 * * * /path/to/scripts/validation/validate_task_integrity.py

# Weekly comprehensive validation
0 3 * * 0 /path/to/scripts/validation/run_validation_pipeline.py ongoing

# Monthly validation reports
0 4 1 * * /path/to/scripts/validation/generate_validation_report.py 30

# Continuous monitoring (every 5 minutes)
*/5 * * * * /path/to/scripts/validation/continuous_monitoring.py once
```
