# Task List: Website Issues and Recommended Fixes

This document outlines the issues found during the website spidering test and provides recommendations for fixing them.

## High Priority

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP) Violations on /admin

*   **Issue:** The `/admin` page has strict Content Security Policy (CSP) rules that are blocking stylesheets and scripts from loading. This is a critical security vulnerability that can expose the site to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   **Recommendation:** Review the CSP directives in the application's configuration and adjust them to allow the necessary resources to load. This may involve adding nonces or hashes for inline scripts and styles, or adding the appropriate domains to the `script-src` and `style-src` directives.


## Medium Priority

### 3. Fix X-Frame-Options Header

*   **Issue:** The `X-Frame-Options` header is currently being set in a `<meta>` tag, which is not effective. This header should be sent as an HTTP header to prevent clickjacking attacks.
*   **Recommendation:** Configure the web server or application to send the `X-Frame-Options` header with a value of `DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN` for all responses.

### 4. Investigate SessionSync Errors

*   **Issue:** The browser console is showing `[SessionSync] Failed to sync session state` errors. This indicates a problem with the session management JavaScript.
*   **Recommendation:** Debug the `SessionSync` JavaScript to identify the cause of the error and implement a fix. This may involve checking for null values, handling exceptions, or adjusting the timing of the session sync calls.

### 5. Resolve WebSocket Connection Errors

*   **Issue:** The `/admin` page is showing WebSocket connection errors.
*   **Recommendation:** Investigate the WebSocket server and client-side code to identify the cause of the connection errors. This may involve checking the WebSocket URL, ensuring the server is running and accessible, and debugging the WebSocket connection handshake.
