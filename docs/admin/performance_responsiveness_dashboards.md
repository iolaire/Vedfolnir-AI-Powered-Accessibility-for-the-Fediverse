# Performance and Responsiveness Dashboards

## Overview

The Vedfolnir admin interface now includes dedicated Performance and Responsiveness dashboards, providing specialized monitoring and optimization capabilities for system administrators.

## Performance Dashboard

**Route**: `/admin/performance`  
**Navigation**: Admin → Performance

### Features

- **Real-time System Metrics**: CPU usage, memory consumption, disk utilization
- **Application Performance**: Request rates, response times, slow request tracking
- **Database Monitoring**: Connection pool utilization, active connections
- **Interactive Charts**: Visual representation of system and application metrics
- **Auto-refresh**: Metrics update every 30 seconds automatically

### Key Metrics Displayed

#### System Resources
- CPU Usage percentage
- Memory usage (percentage and GB)
- Disk usage (percentage and GB)
- Real-time resource utilization

#### Application Performance
- Requests per second
- Average response time
- Total requests processed
- Slow request count
- Background tasks count

#### Database Performance
- Active database connections
- Maximum connections available
- Connection pool utilization percentage

### API Endpoints

- `GET /admin/api/performance/metrics` - Real-time performance data
- `GET /admin/api/performance/history` - Historical performance data (24 hours)

## Responsiveness Dashboard

**Route**: `/admin/responsiveness`  
**Navigation**: Admin → Responsiveness

### Features

- **Responsiveness Status**: Overall system health assessment
- **Threshold Monitoring**: Visual indicators for critical thresholds
- **Issue Detection**: Automatic identification of responsiveness problems
- **Optimization Actions**: One-click memory and connection optimization
- **Recommendations**: AI-driven suggestions for performance improvements

### Key Metrics Displayed

#### Responsiveness Overview
- Overall system status (Healthy/Warning/Critical)
- Memory usage with threshold indicators
- CPU usage with visual progress bars
- Average response time vs. target thresholds
- Connection pool utilization

#### Issues and Recommendations
- Current responsiveness issues
- Automated optimization suggestions
- Manual optimization controls
- Real-time threshold monitoring

### Optimization Actions

#### Memory Optimization
- **Action**: Optimize Memory button
- **Function**: Triggers system memory cleanup
- **Rate Limit**: 5 operations per 5 minutes
- **Notification**: Success/failure feedback

#### Connection Optimization
- **Action**: Optimize Connections button
- **Function**: Cleans up database connection pool
- **Rate Limit**: 3 operations per 5 minutes
- **Notification**: Real-time status updates

### API Endpoints

- `GET /admin/api/responsiveness/overview` - Responsiveness overview data
- `POST /admin/api/responsiveness/check` - Run comprehensive responsiveness check
- `POST /admin/api/responsiveness/optimize` - Trigger optimization (memory/connections)

## Thresholds and Alerts

### Default Thresholds
- **Memory Usage**: 80% warning threshold
- **CPU Usage**: 85% warning threshold
- **Response Time**: 2.0 seconds maximum
- **Connection Pool**: 90% utilization warning

### Visual Indicators
- **Green**: Normal operation (below thresholds)
- **Yellow**: Warning state (approaching thresholds)
- **Red**: Critical state (exceeding thresholds)

## Integration with Existing Systems

### SystemOptimizer Integration
Both dashboards integrate with the existing SystemOptimizer component when available:
- Real-time performance metrics
- Automated cleanup triggers
- Responsiveness health checks
- Performance recommendations

### Fallback Behavior
When SystemOptimizer is not available:
- Basic system metrics using `psutil`
- Limited optimization capabilities
- Graceful degradation of features

## Security and Access Control

### Admin-Only Access
- Both dashboards require admin role (`UserRole.ADMIN`)
- Automatic redirect for unauthorized users
- Rate limiting on API endpoints

### Rate Limiting
- Performance metrics: 60 requests per minute
- Responsiveness checks: 10 requests per minute
- Optimization actions: Limited frequency (3-5 per 5 minutes)

## Usage Guidelines

### Performance Dashboard
1. Monitor system resources regularly
2. Watch for trends in response times
3. Check connection pool utilization
4. Use historical data for capacity planning

### Responsiveness Dashboard
1. Run responsiveness checks during peak usage
2. Monitor threshold indicators
3. Use optimization actions when issues detected
4. Review recommendations for proactive improvements

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Components
- `app/blueprints/admin/performance_dashboard.py` - Performance routes and logic
- `app/blueprints/admin/responsiveness_dashboard.py` - Responsiveness routes and logic
