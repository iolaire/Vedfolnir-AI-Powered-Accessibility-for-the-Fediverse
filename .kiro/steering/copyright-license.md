## Implementation Requirements

### For New Files
- **ALWAYS** add the appropriate copyright header as the very first content in any new source code file
- Use the correct comment syntax for the file type
- Place the header before any other code, imports, or content
- Leave a blank line after the header before starting the actual code

### For Existing Files
- Add the copyright header to the very top of existing source code files
- Preserve existing functionality while adding the header
- Ensure the header doesn't break any existing syntax or functionality

### Files That Require Headers
- All Python files (.py)
- All JavaScript files (.js)
- All HTML template files (.html)
- All CSS files (.css)
- All shell scripts (.sh)
- All SQL files (.sql)
- Any other source code files

### Files That Don't Require Headers
- Configuration files (JSON, YAML, etc.)
- Documentation files (README.md, etc.)
- Binary files
- Generated files
- Third-party libraries

## Quality Assurance
- Verify that the header doesn't break file functionality
- Ensure proper comment syntax for each file type
- Maintain consistent formatting across all files
- Test that files still work correctly after adding headers
