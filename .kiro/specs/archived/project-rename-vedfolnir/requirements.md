3. WHEN viewing documentation THEN all references SHALL use "Vedfolnir" instead of "Vedfolnir"
4. WHEN checking package metadata THEN the project name SHALL be "Vedfolnir"

### Requirement 2: Update Documentation and User-Facing Content

**User Story:** As a user, I want all documentation and interfaces to consistently use the new project name, so that there is no confusion about the project identity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading documentation files THEN all titles and references SHALL use "Vedfolnir"

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing code comments THEN project references SHALL use "Vedfolnir"
2. WHEN checking docstrings and module headers THEN they SHALL reference "Vedfolnir"
3. WHEN viewing configuration files THEN comments SHALL use the new project name
4. WHEN examining test files THEN test descriptions SHALL reference "Vedfolnir" where appropriate

### Requirement 4: Update Configuration and Metadata

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configuration files and metadata updated with the new name, so that system identification is consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking application configuration THEN project identifiers SHALL use "Vedfolnir"
2. WHEN viewing database schema comments THEN they SHALL reference "Vedfolnir"
3. WHEN examining log file headers THEN they SHALL use the new project name
4. WHEN checking environment variable documentation THEN it SHALL reference "Vedfolnir"

### Requirement 5: Preserve Functionality and History

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want the renaming to preserve all functionality and project history, so that no features are broken and the project evolution is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the renaming is complete THEN all existing functionality SHALL work unchanged
2. WHEN checking version control history THEN all commits and history SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN running tests THEN all tests SHALL pass without modification
4. WHEN accessing existing data THEN it SHALL remain accessible and functional

### Requirement 6: Update File and Directory Names

2. WHEN checking database files THEN they SHALL use appropriate naming conventions
3. WHEN examining log files THEN new logs SHALL use "vedfolnir" in naming
4. WHEN creating new files THEN they SHALL follow "vedfolnir" naming conventions

### Requirement 7: Validation and Testing

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching for old project name THEN no inappropriate references SHALL remain
2. WHEN running the application THEN it SHALL start and function correctly
3. WHEN executing tests THEN all tests SHALL pass
4. WHEN checking web interface THEN all pages SHALL load and display correctly
