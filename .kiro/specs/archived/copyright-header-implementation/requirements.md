# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements copyright and license headers across all source code files in the Vedfolnir project to ensure proper attribution and compliance with the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0. The implementation will add standardized headers to existing files and establish processes to ensure new files include appropriate headers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want all source code files to include proper copyright and license headers, so that the project complies with open source licensing requirements and provides clear attribution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any source code file is examined THEN it SHALL contain the required copyright and license header at the very top
2. WHEN the header is added to a file THEN it SHALL use the correct comment syntax for that file type
3. WHEN the header is added THEN it SHALL not break the existing functionality of the file
4. WHEN a Python file is created or modified THEN it SHALL include the header using # comment syntax
5. WHEN a JavaScript file is created or modified THEN it SHALL include the header using // comment syntax
6. WHEN an HTML file is created or modified THEN it SHALL include the header using <!-- --> comment syntax
7. WHEN a CSS file is created or modified THEN it SHALL include the header using /* */ comment syntax

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the copyright header to be automatically included in new source code files, so that I don't have to remember to add it manually each time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new Python file is created THEN it SHALL automatically include the copyright header
2. WHEN a new JavaScript file is created THEN it SHALL automatically include the copyright header
3. WHEN a new HTML file is created THEN it SHALL automatically include the copyright header
4. WHEN a new CSS file is created THEN it SHALL automatically include the copyright header
5. WHEN any new source code file is created THEN the header SHALL be placed at the very top before any other content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a legal compliance officer, I want all existing source code files to be updated with proper copyright headers, so that the entire codebase is compliant with licensing requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all Python files are processed THEN they SHALL contain the copyright header
2. WHEN all JavaScript files are processed THEN they SHALL contain the copyright header
3. WHEN all HTML template files are processed THEN they SHALL contain the copyright header
4. WHEN all CSS files are processed THEN they SHALL contain the copyright header
5. WHEN files are updated with headers THEN their existing functionality SHALL remain intact

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project contributor, I want clear documentation about copyright header requirements, so that I can properly format headers in my contributions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I review project documentation THEN I SHALL find clear examples of proper header formatting for each file type
2. WHEN I need to add a header THEN I SHALL have access to the exact text and formatting requirements
3. WHEN I create a new file type THEN I SHALL have guidance on how to format the header appropriately
4. WHEN I contribute code THEN the header requirements SHALL be clearly documented in project guidelines

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want to verify that all source code files have proper copyright headers, so that I can ensure compliance across the entire project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run a compliance check THEN I SHALL be able to identify any files missing copyright headers
2. WHEN a file is missing a header THEN the system SHALL provide clear indication of which files need updates
3. WHEN headers are added THEN I SHALL be able to verify they use correct syntax and formatting
4. WHEN new files are added to the project THEN I SHALL be able to verify they include proper headers

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the copyright header implementation to not interfere with existing build processes or deployment procedures, so that the project continues to function normally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN headers are added to files THEN the build process SHALL continue to work without errors
2. WHEN Python files are updated with headers THEN they SHALL continue to execute properly
3. WHEN JavaScript files are updated with headers THEN they SHALL continue to function in browsers
4. WHEN HTML files are updated with headers THEN they SHALL continue to render correctly
5. WHEN CSS files are updated with headers THEN they SHALL continue to style pages properly
