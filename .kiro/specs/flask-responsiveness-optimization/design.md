## Data Models

### Resource Metrics Model
```python
@dataclass
class ResourceMetrics:
    timestamp: datetime
    memory_usage_percent: float
    memory_usage_mb: float
    cpu_usage_percent: float
    disk_usage_percent: float
    connection_pool_utilization: float
    active_threads: int
    request_queue_size: int
```

```python
@dataclass
class PerformanceMetrics:

```

## Error Handling

### Connection Error Recovery
- Implement exponential backoff for database reconnections
- Fallback to alternative connection pools
- Graceful degradation when connections are unavailable

### Memory Error Prevention
- Automatic garbage collection triggers
- Emergency memory cleanup procedures
- Request throttling during high memory usage

### Background Task Error Handling
- Task failure isolation
- Automatic task restart with backoff
- Error reporting and alerting

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Resource monitor component testing
- Connection pool manager testing
- Memory leak detector testing
- Performance tracker testing

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end resource monitoring
- Database connection lifecycle testing
- Background task coordination testing
- Health check system validation

### Performance Tests
- Load testing with resource monitoring
- Memory leak detection over time
- Connection pool stress testing
- Request performance under load

### Playwright Tests
- Web application responsiveness testing
- User interface performance validation
- Real-world usage scenario testing
- Automated regression testing

**Test Scenarios**:
1. **Memory Leak Test**: Run application for extended period, monitor memory growth
2. **Connection Pool Test**: Simulate high database load, verify connection management
3. **Background Task Test**: Verify tasks don't block main application
4. **Resource Exhaustion Test**: Simulate resource constraints, verify graceful handling
5. **Recovery Test**: Simulate failures, verify automatic recovery

## Implementation Considerations

### Existing Code Integration
- Enhance existing `SystemOptimizer` class in `web_app.py`
- Integrate with current database connection management
- Extend existing monitoring systems
- Preserve current session management functionality

### Configuration Management
- Add performance monitoring configuration to `config.py`
- Environment variable configuration for thresholds
- Runtime configuration updates without restart

### Monitoring Integration
- Extend existing admin performance dashboard with responsiveness metrics
- Add responsiveness monitoring to existing admin health endpoints
- Integrate with current admin monitoring pages (`/admin/monitoring`, `/admin/health`)
- Add new admin responsiveness dashboard page if comprehensive view is needed
- Utilize existing admin templates and styling for consistency

### Admin Interface Integration
- Add responsiveness metrics to existing admin dashboard widgets
- Extend current monitoring templates with resource usage alerts
- Create new admin page `/admin/responsiveness` for detailed analysis if needed
- Integrate with existing admin navigation and security controls
- Reuse existing admin static assets (CSS, JavaScript) for consistency

### Backward Compatibility
- Maintain existing API interfaces
- Preserve current functionality while adding optimizations
- Extend existing admin routes rather than replacing them
- Gradual rollout of new monitoring features through existing admin interface
