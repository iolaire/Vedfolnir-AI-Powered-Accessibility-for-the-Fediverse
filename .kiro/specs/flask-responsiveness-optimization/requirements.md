# Flask App Responsiveness Optimization - Requirements

## Introduction

The Flask application becomes unresponsive after some time, requiring investigation and optimization to ensure consistent performance. This feature addresses resource exhaustion, blocking operations, memory leaks, and connection management issues that can cause the web application to become unresponsive.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Resource Monitoring and Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive resource monitoring so that I can identify and prevent resource exhaustion before it causes unresponsiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL monitor memory usage, CPU usage, and database connections in real-time
2. WHEN memory usage exceeds 80% THEN the system SHALL log warnings and trigger cleanup operations
3. WHEN database connection pool utilization exceeds 90% THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and implement connection throttling
4. WHEN CPU usage remains above 90% for more than 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL log critical alerts and suggest optimization actions
5. IF resource thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger resource cleanup procedures

### Requirement 2: Connection Pool Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized database connection management so that connection leaks don't cause application unresponsiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database operations are performed THEN all connections SHALL be properly closed using context managers
2. WHEN connection pool reaches maximum capacity THEN the system SHALL queue requests with appropriate timeouts
3. WHEN idle connections exist for more than 1 hour THEN they SHALL be automatically recycled
4. IF connection leaks are detected THEN the system SHALL log detailed diagnostic information
5. WHEN the application starts THEN connection pool settings SHALL be validated and optimized for the deployment environment

### Requirement 3: Background Task Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper background task management so that long-running operations don't block the main application thread.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN background cleanup tasks are running THEN they SHALL not block HTTP request processing
2. WHEN monitoring threads are active THEN they SHALL have proper shutdown mechanisms and timeout handling
3. WHEN WebSocket connections are established THEN they SHALL not consume excessive resources or block other operations
4. IF background tasks encounter errors THEN they SHALL recover gracefully without affecting main application functionality
5. WHEN the application shuts down THEN all background threads SHALL terminate cleanly within 30 seconds

### Requirement 4: Memory Leak Detection and Prevention

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic memory leak detection so that memory issues are identified and resolved before causing unresponsiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL monitor memory usage patterns and detect potential leaks
2. WHEN memory usage increases continuously without corresponding workload THEN the system SHALL alert administrators
3. WHEN session data accumulates THEN expired sessions SHALL be automatically cleaned up
4. IF large objects are created THEN they SHALL be properly garbage collected when no longer needed
5. WHEN cache systems are used THEN they SHALL have size limits and expiration policies

### Requirement 5: Request Processing Optimization

**User Story:** As an end user, I want fast and responsive web requests so that the application remains usable under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HTTP requests are received THEN they SHALL be processed within 5 seconds under normal load
2. WHEN database queries are executed THEN they SHALL complete within 2 seconds or be optimized
3. WHEN multiple requests are processed concurrently THEN they SHALL not interfere with each other's performance
4. IF slow requests are detected THEN they SHALL be logged with detailed timing information
5. WHEN request queues build up THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate backpressure mechanisms

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust error handling so that temporary issues don't cause permanent unresponsiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database connection errors occur THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
2. WHEN Redis connection fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to database sessions gracefully
3. WHEN external API calls timeout THEN they SHALL not block other application functionality
4. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed diagnostic information
5. WHEN recovery operations are needed THEN they SHALL execute automatically without manual intervention

### Requirement 7: Performance Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive performance tests so that responsiveness improvements can be validated and regressions prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance tests are run THEN they SHALL simulate realistic load patterns and measure response times
2. WHEN memory leak tests execute THEN they SHALL run for extended periods and detect gradual memory increases
3. WHEN connection pool tests run THEN they SHALL verify proper connection lifecycle management
4. IF performance regressions are detected THEN tests SHALL fail and provide detailed diagnostic information
5. WHEN tests complete THEN they SHALL generate reports with actionable performance recommendations
