# WebSocket CORS Standardization Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses the need to refactor the existing WebSocket implementation to resolve CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues and standardize Socket.IO/flask-socketio configuration across both user and admin interfaces. The current implementation has CORS-related connection issues and lacks a unified configuration approach that works consistently across different environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dynamic CORS Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the WebSocket system to dynamically configure CORS origins based on environment variables, so that the application works seamlessly across development, staging, and production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL read FLASK_HOST and FLASK_PORT from environment variables
2. WHEN constructing CORS origins THEN the system SHALL create dynamic origin URLs using the format `http://{FLASK_HOST}:{FLASK_PORT}` and `https://{FLASK_HOST}:{FLASK_PORT}`
3. WHEN FLASK_HOST is localhost or 127.0.0.1 THEN the system SHALL include both localhost and 127.0.0.1 variants in allowed origins
4. WHEN the environment is production THEN the system SHALL support HTTPS origins and proper SSL configuration
5. IF environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL fall back to secure defaults (localhost:5000)

### Requirement 2: Unified Socket.IO Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a standardized Socket.IO configuration that works consistently for both user and admin interfaces, so that I don't have to maintain separate configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing Socket.IO THEN the system SHALL use a single, reusable configuration class
2. WHEN configuring transports THEN the system SHALL support both WebSocket and polling with proper fallback mechanisms
3. WHEN setting up authentication THEN the system SHALL use consistent authentication patterns across user and admin interfaces
4. WHEN handling namespaces THEN the system SHALL properly separate user and admin functionality while sharing common configuration
5. WHEN configuring timeouts THEN the system SHALL use environment-configurable timeout values

### Requirement 3: Environment-Based Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want WebSocket configuration to be managed through environment variables, so that I can easily configure the system for different deployment environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading configuration THEN the system SHALL support environment variables for all WebSocket settings
2. WHEN SOCKETIO_CORS_ORIGINS is set THEN the system SHALL use the specified origins instead of auto-generated ones
3. WHEN SOCKETIO_TRANSPORTS is configured THEN the system SHALL use the specified transport methods
4. WHEN SOCKETIO_TIMEOUT values are set THEN the system SHALL apply the configured timeout settings
5. WHEN environment variables are invalid THEN the system SHALL log warnings and use safe defaults

### Requirement 4: Robust CORS Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when WebSocket connections fail due to CORS issues, so that I can understand what's happening and take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a CORS error occurs THEN the system SHALL detect and categorize the specific CORS issue
2. WHEN CORS preflight requests fail THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate OPTIONS handlers
3. WHEN origin validation fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
4. WHEN CORS errors are detected THEN the client SHALL display user-friendly error messages
5. WHEN CORS issues persist THEN the system SHALL provide fallback connection methods

### Requirement 5: Standardized Client Connection Logic

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want consistent WebSocket client behavior across user and admin interfaces, so that connection handling is predictable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing client connections THEN the system SHALL use shared connection configuration
2. WHEN handling connection failures THEN the system SHALL implement consistent retry logic with exponential backoff
3. WHEN switching between user and admin contexts THEN the system SHALL maintain connection state appropriately
4. WHEN authentication changes THEN the system SHALL handle reconnection automatically
5. WHEN network conditions change THEN the system SHALL adapt transport methods intelligently

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Security and Authentication

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want WebSocket connections to maintain the same security standards as the rest of the application, so that real-time features don't introduce security vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN establishing connections THEN the system SHALL validate user authentication consistently
2. WHEN handling admin connections THEN the system SHALL verify admin privileges before joining admin rooms
3. WHEN processing WebSocket events THEN the system SHALL apply the same CSRF protection as HTTP requests
4. WHEN rate limiting is enabled THEN the system SHALL apply consistent rate limits to WebSocket connections
5. WHEN security violations occur THEN the system SHALL log security events and disconnect malicious clients

### Requirement 7: Comprehensive Error Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the WebSocket system to automatically recover from connection issues, so that real-time features continue working even when network conditions are poor.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connection drops occur THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic reconnection with intelligent backoff
2. WHEN WebSocket transport fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to polling transport automatically
3. WHEN server restarts occur THEN the system SHALL detect and handle server unavailability gracefully
4. WHEN browser suspends connections THEN the system SHALL detect suspension and switch to polling mode
5. WHEN recovery succeeds THEN the system SHALL restore previous connection state and subscriptions

### Requirement 8: Real-Time Notification Standardization

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent real-time notifications across user and admin interfaces, so that the notification experience is uniform throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN notifications are sent THEN the system SHALL use standardized message formats across all interfaces
2. WHEN targeting specific users THEN the system SHALL route notifications to appropriate rooms/namespaces
3. WHEN handling admin notifications THEN the system SHALL ensure only authorized users receive admin-specific messages
4. WHEN connection quality varies THEN the system SHALL adapt notification delivery methods appropriately
5. WHEN notifications fail to deliver THEN the system SHALL provide fallback notification mechanisms

### Requirement 9: Development and Debugging Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive debugging tools for WebSocket connections, so that I can quickly identify and resolve connection issues during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debug mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide detailed connection logging
2. WHEN CORS issues occur THEN the system SHALL log specific CORS error details and suggested fixes
3. WHEN testing connections THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic tools and connection test utilities
4. WHEN monitoring connections THEN the system SHALL expose connection metrics and health status
5. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation and debugging guides

### Requirement 10: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the WebSocket system to perform efficiently and scale appropriately, so that real-time features don't impact overall application performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling multiple connections THEN the system SHALL manage connection pools efficiently
2. WHEN broadcasting messages THEN the system SHALL optimize message delivery for performance
3. WHEN scaling horizontally THEN the system SHALL support multiple application instances
4. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL track connection metrics and resource usage
5. WHEN resource limits are reached THEN the system SHALL handle graceful degradation
