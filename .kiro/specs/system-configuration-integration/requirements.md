# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate the existing system configuration management interface with the actual application runtime behavior. Currently, the system configuration management page allows administrators to view and modify configuration values, but these values are not used by the application's core services. This integration will make configuration changes immediately effective throughout the application, enabling true runtime configuration management.

The integration will create a service layer that bridges the configuration management system with all application components that currently use hardcoded values, providing centralized, dynamic configuration management with proper fallback mechanisms and performance optimization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Configuration Service Layer

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configuration changes to automatically affect application behavior, so that I can tune system performance and limits without code changes or application restarts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN a configuration service SHALL be initialized that provides cached access to all system configurations
2. WHEN a configuration value is requested THEN the service SHALL return the current value from the database with environment variable override support
3. WHEN a configuration value is not found in the database THEN the service SHALL return the schema default value
4. WHEN a configuration is marked as requiring restart THEN the service SHALL log a warning that restart is needed for the change to take effect
5. WHEN the configuration service is accessed frequently THEN it SHALL use caching to minimize database queries with configurable cache TTL

### Requirement 2: Dynamic Configuration Refresh

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want some configuration changes to take effect immediately without restarting the application, so that I can respond quickly to operational needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a configuration is updated through the admin interface THEN the configuration service cache SHALL be invalidated for that key
2. WHEN a configuration supports hot-reload THEN dependent services SHALL be notified of the change
3. WHEN a configuration requires restart THEN the admin interface SHALL display a warning and track pending restart-required changes
4. WHEN the application receives a configuration refresh signal THEN it SHALL reload all hot-reloadable configurations
5. WHEN configuration refresh fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue using cached values

### Requirement 3: Task Queue Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to control concurrent job limits and timeouts through the configuration interface, so that I can optimize system performance based on current load and resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the task queue manager initializes THEN it SHALL read `max_concurrent_jobs` from the configuration service
2. WHEN a new job is queued THEN the system SHALL check against the current `max_concurrent_jobs` limit
3. WHEN a job starts THEN it SHALL use the `default_job_timeout` value from configuration
4. WHEN `max_concurrent_jobs` is updated THEN the task queue SHALL adjust its concurrency limits within 60 seconds
5. WHEN `queue_size_limit` is reached THEN new jobs SHALL be rejected with appropriate error messages

### Requirement 4: Session Management Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to control session timeouts and security settings through the configuration interface, so that I can balance security and user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new session is created THEN it SHALL use `session_timeout_minutes` from configuration
2. WHEN session timeout is updated THEN existing sessions SHALL maintain their original timeout until next activity
3. WHEN `rate_limit_per_user_per_hour` is changed THEN the rate limiting service SHALL update its limits immediately
4. WHEN session security settings are modified THEN new sessions SHALL use the updated settings
5. WHEN audit log retention is changed THEN the cleanup service SHALL use the new `audit_log_retention_days` value

### Requirement 5: Alert System Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure alert thresholds through the interface, so that I can customize monitoring based on my system's characteristics and requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the alert manager initializes THEN it SHALL read all `alert_*_threshold` values from configuration
2. WHEN `alert_queue_backup_threshold` is updated THEN the monitoring system SHALL use the new threshold immediately
3. WHEN `alert_error_rate_threshold` is changed THEN error rate monitoring SHALL apply the new threshold to future calculations
4. WHEN `alert_notification_channels` is modified THEN the alert system SHALL update its delivery mechanisms
5. WHEN alert thresholds are invalid THEN the system SHALL use schema defaults and log warnings

### Requirement 6: Feature Flag Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to enable or disable system features through configuration, so that I can control functionality without code deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `enable_batch_processing` is disabled THEN batch processing endpoints SHALL return "feature disabled" responses
2. WHEN `enable_advanced_monitoring` is toggled THEN monitoring services SHALL start or stop advanced metrics collection
3. WHEN `enable_auto_retry` is disabled THEN failed jobs SHALL not be automatically retried
4. WHEN feature flags are changed THEN dependent services SHALL be notified within 30 seconds
5. WHEN a feature is disabled while in use THEN current operations SHALL complete but new operations SHALL be blocked

### Requirement 7: Maintenance Mode Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want maintenance mode to be controlled through configuration and immediately affect system behavior, so that I can safely perform maintenance operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `maintenance_mode` is enabled THEN new job creation SHALL be blocked with maintenance message
2. WHEN `maintenance_mode` is enabled THEN the `maintenance_reason` SHALL be displayed to users
3. WHEN maintenance mode is activated THEN running jobs SHALL be allowed to complete
4. WHEN maintenance mode is disabled THEN normal operations SHALL resume immediately
5. WHEN maintenance mode status is checked THEN the response SHALL reflect the current configuration value

### Requirement 8: Performance Optimization Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to tune performance settings through configuration, so that I can optimize resource usage based on system capacity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `max_memory_usage_mb` is updated THEN job processing SHALL enforce the new memory limit
2. WHEN `processing_priority_weights` is changed THEN the job scheduler SHALL use new priority calculations
3. WHEN performance settings are invalid THEN the system SHALL use safe defaults and log warnings
4. WHEN memory limits are exceeded THEN jobs SHALL be terminated gracefully with appropriate error messages
5. WHEN priority weights are updated THEN queued jobs SHALL be reordered according to new weights

### Requirement 9: Configuration Validation and Safety

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configuration changes to be validated before application, so that invalid settings don't break system functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a configuration is updated THEN it SHALL be validated against schema rules before being applied
2. WHEN configuration validation fails THEN the change SHALL be rejected with detailed error messages
3. WHEN conflicting configurations are detected THEN warnings SHALL be displayed in the admin interface
4. WHEN critical configurations are changed THEN additional confirmation SHALL be required
5. WHEN configuration changes could impact system stability THEN warnings SHALL be displayed with impact assessment

### Requirement 10: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor configuration usage and changes, so that I can understand the impact of configuration modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configurations are accessed THEN usage metrics SHALL be collected for performance analysis
2. WHEN configuration cache hits/misses occur THEN metrics SHALL be recorded for optimization
3. WHEN configuration changes are applied THEN the impact on system behavior SHALL be logged
4. WHEN configuration service errors occur THEN detailed error information SHALL be logged and alerted
5. WHEN configuration refresh operations happen THEN timing and success metrics SHALL be tracked

### Requirement 11: Backward Compatibility and Migration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the configuration integration to work seamlessly with existing environment variable overrides, so that current deployment practices remain functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment variables are set THEN they SHALL take precedence over database configuration values
2. WHEN configuration keys don't exist in database THEN schema defaults SHALL be used without errors
3. WHEN the configuration service is unavailable THEN applications SHALL fall back to hardcoded defaults
4. WHEN migrating from hardcoded values THEN existing behavior SHALL be preserved through equivalent default values
5. WHEN configuration service fails THEN system SHALL continue operating with last known good values

### Requirement 12: Admin Interface Enhancements

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the configuration interface to show which settings require restart and provide feedback on configuration impact, so that I can make informed decisions about changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing configurations THEN the interface SHALL indicate which settings require application restart
2. WHEN changing configurations THEN the interface SHALL show warnings about potential system impact
3. WHEN configurations have dependencies THEN related settings SHALL be highlighted
4. WHEN configuration changes are pending restart THEN a system-wide notification SHALL be displayed
5. WHEN testing configuration changes THEN a "dry run" mode SHALL be available to preview impacts
