# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The comprehensive test suite is failing with 54 total failures and errors across multiple test categories (21 failures, 33 errors). These failures indicate critical issues in core functionality including task queue management, platform context handling, session management, mock object handling, and configuration validation. The system needs systematic fixes to restore test reliability and ensure proper functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Task Queue Management Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the task queue management system to handle task operations correctly, so that task creation, cancellation, and status updates work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task is cancelled THEN the system SHALL properly handle the task status validation
2. WHEN a task completion is requested for a nonexistent task THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages
3. WHEN progress callbacks encounter errors THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without breaking the task flow
4. WHEN multiple users attempt to access tasks THEN the system SHALL enforce proper ownership validation
5. WHEN task queue management code has errors THEN all code errors SHALL be identified and fixed

### Requirement 2: Platform Context Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want platform context operations to handle missing or invalid platform connections gracefully, so that the system remains stable when platform data is inconsistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting platform context for a nonexistent platform connection THEN the system SHALL return clear error messages
2. WHEN setting platform context for inactive platform connections THEN the system SHALL handle the failure gracefully
3. WHEN platform context operations encounter invalid user IDs THEN the system SHALL validate input and prevent SQL injection attempts
4. WHEN platform switching operations fail THEN the system SHALL maintain system stability
5. WHEN platform context management code has errors THEN all code errors SHALL be identified and fixed

### Requirement 3: Session Management Stability

**User Story:** As a web application user, I want session management to work reliably, so that authentication and user state management function correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN web tests run THEN session initialization SHALL complete without errors
2. WHEN session error logging is initialized THEN it SHALL not interfere with test execution
3. WHEN session-related operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages
4. WHEN multiple concurrent sessions exist THEN the system SHALL handle them without conflicts
5. WHEN session management code has errors THEN all code errors SHALL be identified and fixed

### Requirement 4: Mock Object Handling

**User Story:** As a test developer, I want mock objects to be properly configured and handled, so that tests can run reliably without external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mock objects are used in async contexts THEN they SHALL be properly configured for async operations
2. WHEN mock objects represent database queries THEN they SHALL return appropriate mock data structures
3. WHEN mock objects are unpacked THEN they SHALL be configured to support tuple unpacking operations
4. WHEN mock objects are used in platform operations THEN they SHALL simulate real platform behavior accurately
5. WHEN mock object handling code has errors THEN all code errors SHALL be identified and fixed

### Requirement 5: Platform Integration Reliability

**User Story:** As a platform integration developer, I want platform-specific operations to handle authentication and API calls correctly, so that multi-platform support works reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating Mastodon access tokens THEN the system SHALL handle async token validation properly
2. WHEN updating media captions THEN the system SHALL use the correct API methods for each platform type
3. WHEN detecting platform types THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback for unknown platforms
4. WHEN platform API calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling and fallback mechanisms
5. WHEN platform integration code has errors THEN all code errors SHALL be identified and fixed

### Requirement 6: Configuration Validation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configuration validation to work correctly, so that system setup and environment configuration can be verified reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration tests run THEN they SHALL validate all required configuration parameters
2. WHEN environment variables are missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear validation messages
3. WHEN configuration validation fails THEN the system SHALL indicate specific configuration issues
4. WHEN configuration is updated THEN the system SHALL re-validate and apply changes correctly
5. WHEN configuration validation code has errors THEN all code errors SHALL be identified and fixed

### Requirement 7: Performance Test Stability

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want performance tests to run without interference from concurrent operations, so that performance metrics can be measured accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance tests create multiple users THEN they SHALL not conflict with existing active tasks
2. WHEN load testing is performed THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent operations without task conflicts
3. WHEN performance tests access user tasks THEN they SHALL respect task ownership and access controls
4. WHEN performance monitoring runs THEN it SHALL not interfere with normal system operations
5. WHEN performance test code has errors THEN all code errors SHALL be identified and fixed

### Requirement 8: Error Handling Robustness

**User Story:** As a system user, I want error handling to be robust and informative, so that when issues occur, they are handled gracefully with clear feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur in platform switching THEN the system SHALL handle them without crashing
2. WHEN mock objects are used incorrectly THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and provide recovery options
4. WHEN API calls encounter errors THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry mechanisms and fallback strategies
5. WHEN error handling code has errors THEN all code errors SHALL be identified and fixed
