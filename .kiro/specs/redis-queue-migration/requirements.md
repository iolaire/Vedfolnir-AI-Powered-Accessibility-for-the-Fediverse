# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the migration from the current database-polling task processing system to Redis Queue (RQ) with multi-priority task processing. The current system uses database polling with separate worker processes (`caption_worker.py`, `simple_caption_worker.py`) that continuously query the database for queued tasks. This approach has limitations in scalability, resource efficiency, and integration with Gunicorn-based web applications.

The new system will leverage Redis Queue (RQ) to provide efficient, scalable task processing with priority queues, better resource utilization, and seamless integration with the existing Redis infrastructure already used for session management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Redis Queue Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to use Redis Queue for task processing so that I can have efficient, scalable task management with better resource utilization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is configured THEN RQ SHALL use the existing Redis instance for task queuing
2. WHEN RQ is initialized THEN it SHALL create separate queues for different priority levels (urgent, high, normal, low)
3. WHEN the Redis connection is established THEN RQ SHALL verify connectivity and log connection status
4. IF Redis is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to database-only mode with appropriate logging
5. WHEN RQ workers are started THEN they SHALL connect to the appropriate priority queues in order

### Requirement 2: Multi-Priority Task Processing

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want tasks to be processed based on priority levels so that urgent caption generation requests are handled before lower priority ones.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task is enqueued THEN it SHALL be placed in the appropriate priority queue (urgent, high, normal, low)
2. WHEN multiple tasks exist THEN workers SHALL process urgent queue first, then high, normal, and low in that order
3. WHEN admin users submit tasks THEN they SHALL automatically receive high priority unless specified otherwise
4. WHEN regular users submit tasks THEN they SHALL receive normal priority by default
5. WHEN system maintenance tasks are created THEN they SHALL receive urgent priority
6. WHEN a task is enqueued with invalid priority THEN it SHALL default to normal priority with appropriate logging

### Requirement 3: Gunicorn Integration and Worker Coordination

**User Story:** As a developer, I want RQ workers to integrate seamlessly with Gunicorn so that task processing works efficiently in production environments with proper coordination.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Gunicorn starts THEN RQ workers SHALL be initialized using Flask's modern startup handlers (not deprecated @app.before_first_request)
2. WHEN the web application receives a task request THEN it SHALL enqueue the task to RQ without blocking the HTTP response
3. WHEN Gunicorn workers restart THEN RQ workers SHALL gracefully shutdown and restart without losing tasks
4. WHEN the application shuts down THEN RQ workers SHALL complete current tasks and shutdown gracefully within a configurable timeout
5. WHEN multiple Gunicorn workers are running THEN RQ workers SHALL use Redis-based coordination with unique worker IDs to prevent duplicate task processing
6. WHEN RQ workers are initialized THEN each worker SHALL have proper Flask application context for database and service access

### Requirement 4: Task Migration and Single-Task-Per-User Enforcement

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want existing queued tasks to be migrated to RQ while maintaining the current single-task-per-user business rule so that no work is lost and user expectations are preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration starts THEN existing database tasks in QUEUED status SHALL be migrated to appropriate RQ queues
2. WHEN tasks are migrated THEN their priority, user information, settings, and secure task IDs SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN a new task is enqueued THEN the system SHALL enforce single-task-per-user constraint using Redis-based tracking
4. WHEN tasks are processed via RQ THEN they SHALL update the same database records for compatibility and use existing CaptionSecurityManager for task ID generation
5. WHEN the system runs in hybrid mode THEN both RQ and database tasks SHALL be supported during transition with consistent user task enforcement
6. WHEN a user attempts to submit multiple tasks THEN the system SHALL reject subsequent tasks until the active task completes

### Requirement 5: Progress Tracking and WebSocket Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time progress updates for my caption generation tasks so that I know the current status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task starts processing THEN progress updates SHALL be sent via WebSocket to the user's browser
2. WHEN task progress changes THEN the database record SHALL be updated for persistence
3. WHEN a user reconnects THEN they SHALL receive the current task status from the database
4. WHEN multiple users have active tasks THEN progress updates SHALL be isolated per user session
5. WHEN a task completes or fails THEN a final status update SHALL be sent via WebSocket

### Requirement 6: Error Handling, Retry Logic, and Redis Resilience

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust error handling and retry capabilities with automatic Redis failure detection so that temporary failures don't result in lost work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task fails THEN RQ SHALL automatically retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
2. WHEN all retries are exhausted THEN the task SHALL be marked as FAILED in the database
3. WHEN a worker crashes THEN RQ SHALL automatically restart the worker process with proper cleanup
4. WHEN Redis becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL automatically detect the failure within 30 seconds and fallback to database queuing
5. WHEN Redis reconnects THEN queued database tasks SHALL be migrated back to RQ automatically
6. WHEN task processing encounters errors THEN detailed error information SHALL be logged and stored with proper database session management
7. WHEN Redis memory limits are approached THEN the system SHALL implement overflow handling and alert administrators
8. WHEN database sessions are used in RQ workers THEN proper session lifecycle management SHALL prevent connection leaks

### Requirement 7: Monitoring and Administration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring of the RQ system so that I can track performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the admin dashboard is accessed THEN it SHALL display RQ queue statistics (pending, processing, failed, completed)
2. WHEN queue monitoring is enabled THEN metrics SHALL include processing times, success rates, and worker status
3. WHEN administrators view task management THEN they SHALL see both RQ and database task information
4. WHEN performance issues occur THEN alerts SHALL be generated for queue backlog, worker failures, or processing delays
5. WHEN maintenance is required THEN administrators SHALL be able to pause/resume queues and manage worker processes

### Requirement 8: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible configuration options so that RQ behavior can be tuned for different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN RQ configuration SHALL be loaded from environment variables
2. WHEN queue settings are changed THEN workers SHALL adapt without requiring application restart
3. WHEN different environments are used THEN RQ SHALL support development, staging, and production configurations
4. WHEN Redis connection parameters change THEN RQ SHALL reconnect automatically
5. WHEN worker concurrency needs adjustment THEN it SHALL be configurable per queue priority level

### Requirement 9: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want optimized performance so that task processing is efficient and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tasks are enqueued THEN the operation SHALL complete in under 10ms on average
2. WHEN workers process tasks THEN memory usage SHALL not exceed 500MB per worker process
3. WHEN high task volumes occur THEN the system SHALL scale worker processes automatically up to configured limits
4. WHEN tasks complete THEN cleanup operations SHALL prevent memory leaks and resource accumulation
5. WHEN system load is high THEN RQ SHALL prioritize task processing over administrative operations

### Requirement 10: Backward Compatibility and Migration Path

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a smooth migration path so that the transition to RQ doesn't disrupt existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RQ is deployed THEN existing caption generation workflows SHALL continue to function
2. WHEN users access the web interface THEN task submission and monitoring SHALL work identically to the current system
3. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL return the same response formats as before
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN old worker processes SHALL be safely removable
5. WHEN rollback is needed THEN the system SHALL be able to revert to database-only task processing

### Requirement 11: Security and Data Management

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want secure task processing with proper data management so that sensitive information is protected and system resources are managed effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tasks are created THEN they SHALL use the existing CaptionSecurityManager for secure task ID generation
2. WHEN sensitive task data is stored in Redis THEN it SHALL be encrypted using the existing platform encryption mechanisms
3. WHEN Redis memory usage exceeds configured thresholds THEN the system SHALL implement automatic cleanup and alerting
4. WHEN task data is no longer needed THEN it SHALL be automatically purged according to configurable retention policies
5. WHEN workers access the database THEN they SHALL use proper authentication and session management
6. WHEN task processing fails THEN error messages SHALL be sanitized to prevent information leakage
