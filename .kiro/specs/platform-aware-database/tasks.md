**Total Estimated Time:** 36 days (approximately 7-8 weeks)

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- Tasks 3.2 and 3.3 can be developed in parallel after 3.1
- Tasks 4.1 and 4.2 can overlap with Phase 3 development
- Documentation (6.1) can begin during Phase 5
- Testing tasks can be developed incrementally alongside implementation

### Resource Requirements
- **Developer Time:** 1 full-time developer
- **Database Expertise:** SQLAlchemy, encryption, migration patterns
- **Frontend Skills:** Flask templates, JavaScript, responsive design
- **Security Knowledge:** Credential encryption, access control
- **Testing Expertise:** Unit testing, integration testing, performance testing

### Risk Mitigation
- **Data Safety:** Comprehensive backup and rollback procedures
- **Migration Complexity:** Incremental migration with validation steps
- **Performance Impact:** Performance testing throughout development
- **Security Concerns:** Security review of credential handling
- **User Experience:** User testing of platform management interface
