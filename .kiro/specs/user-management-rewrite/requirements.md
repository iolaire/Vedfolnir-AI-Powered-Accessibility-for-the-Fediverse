# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the complete rewrite of the Vedfolnir user management system to address current implementation errors and provide comprehensive role-based access control with GDPR compliance. The system will support two distinct user roles (Admin and Viewer) with clearly defined permissions, secure authentication flows, and complete data protection compliance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Role System

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a clear role-based access control system so that users have appropriate permissions based on their role.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is initialized THEN it SHALL support exactly two user roles: Admin and Viewer
2. WHEN an Admin user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL grant full site access including admin areas
3. WHEN an Admin user manages other users THEN the system SHALL maintain their admin session without interruption
4. WHEN a Viewer user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL restrict access to only their own platforms and content
5. WHEN a user attempts to access unauthorized resources THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt

### Requirement 2: User Registration and Authentication

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register with email verification so that my account is secure and verified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user registers THEN the system SHALL require a valid email address using email_validator
2. WHEN a user submits registration THEN the system SHALL send an email verification link using flask-mailing
3. WHEN a user clicks the verification link THEN the system SHALL activate their account and allow login
4. WHEN a user attempts to login without email verification THEN the system SHALL deny access and prompt for verification
5. WHEN any form is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate CSRF tokens to prevent cross-site request forgery
6. WHEN an admin creates a user via terminal THEN the system SHALL bypass email verification requirements
7. WHEN an admin creates a user via web interface THEN the system SHALL maintain admin session and send verification email to new user

### Requirement 3: Email System Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a reliable email system so that users receive necessary communications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system needs to send emails THEN it SHALL use flask-mailing for all email communications
2. WHEN email configuration is needed THEN the system SHALL load credentials from a dedicated email .env file
3. WHEN environment secrets are generated THEN the system SHALL include email settings in generate_env_secrets.py
4. WHEN environment setup is verified THEN the system SHALL validate email configuration in verify_env_setup.py
5. WHEN email sending fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and provide fallback mechanisms

### Requirement 4: User Profile Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my profile information so that I can keep my account details current.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses profile settings THEN the system SHALL allow editing of email address and name fields
2. WHEN a user changes their email address THEN the system SHALL require re-verification via email
3. WHEN a user updates their profile THEN the system SHALL validate all input data and apply changes immediately
4. WHEN profile changes are made THEN the system SHALL log the changes for audit purposes
5. WHEN a user cancels profile editing THEN the system SHALL revert to original values without saving

### Requirement 5: User Profile Deletion

**User Story:** As a user, I want to delete my profile completely so that all my data is removed from the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests profile deletion THEN the system SHALL remove all user images from storage directories
2. WHEN profile deletion is confirmed THEN the system SHALL delete all database entries related to the user
3. WHEN user data is deleted THEN the system SHALL remove all associated platforms and content
4. WHEN deletion is complete THEN the system SHALL follow GDPR compliant deletion processes
5. WHEN deletion fails THEN the system SHALL rollback partial deletions and notify the user
6. WHEN an admin user is deleted THEN the system SHALL ensure at least one admin user remains in the system

### Requirement 6: Password Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure password reset functionality so that I can regain access to my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests password reset THEN the system SHALL implement reset functionality via a new non admin process
2. WHEN password reset is initiated THEN the system SHALL send secure password reset emails with time-limited tokens
3. WHEN a reset token is used THEN the system SHALL expire the token and force password change on first use
4. WHEN password reset is completed THEN the system SHALL invalidate all existing user sessions
5. WHEN reset tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up expired tokens

### Requirement 7: Admin User Management

**User Story:** As an admin, I want comprehensive user management capabilities so that I can effectively administer the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses user management THEN the system SHALL display all users with their roles and status
2. WHEN an admin resets any user's password THEN the system SHALL generate secure temporary passwords
3. WHEN an admin manages users THEN the system SHALL maintain admin session without interruption
4. WHEN an admin creates new users THEN the system SHALL allow role assignment and send appropriate notifications
5. WHEN admin actions are performed THEN the system SHALL log all administrative activities

### Requirement 8: Viewer User Permissions

**User Story:** As a viewer user, I want to manage my own platforms and content so that I can use the system effectively within my permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a viewer user adds platforms THEN the system SHALL allow platform creation and configuration
2. WHEN a viewer user manages platforms THEN the system SHALL restrict access to only their own platforms
3. WHEN a viewer user generates captions THEN the system SHALL limit operations to their own platforms
4. WHEN a viewer user reviews images THEN the system SHALL show only images from their platforms
5. WHEN a viewer user posts content THEN the system SHALL restrict posting to their approved images and platforms

### Requirement 9: GDPR Compliance

**User Story:** As a data subject, I want my personal data to be protected according to GDPR requirements so that my privacy rights are respected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests data access THEN the system SHALL provide all personal data in a readable format
2. WHEN a user requests data rectification THEN the system SHALL allow profile editing with proper validation
3. WHEN a user requests data erasure THEN the system SHALL completely remove all personal data
4. WHEN data is collected THEN the system SHALL provide clear privacy notices and consent mechanisms
5. WHEN data operations occur THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trails for compliance verification
6. WHEN data is processed THEN the system SHALL ensure data portability considerations are met

### Requirement 10: Security and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust security and error handling so that the system is reliable and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information without exposing sensitive data
3. WHEN sessions are managed THEN the system SHALL use secure session tokens with appropriate expiration
4. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper transaction rollback mechanisms
5. WHEN security events occur THEN the system SHALL log and alert administrators appropriately
