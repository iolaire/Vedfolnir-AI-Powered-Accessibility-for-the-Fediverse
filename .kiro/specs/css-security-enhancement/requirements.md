# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses security vulnerabilities caused by inline CSS styles in HTML templates. Inline styles can cause Content Security Policy (CSP) violations and create security risks. The solution involves extracting all inline CSS from HTML templates and moving them to external CSS files, improving security posture while maintaining visual functionality.

**Important Exception**: Email templates (`templates/emails/`) are intentionally excluded from this enhancement as they require inline CSS for proper rendering across email clients. Email templates will retain their inline styles as this is an industry best practice for HTML emails.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security-conscious administrator, I want all inline CSS removed from HTML templates, so that the application complies with strict Content Security Policy rules and reduces security vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning HTML templates THEN the system SHALL identify all inline style attributes excluding email templates
2. WHEN inline styles are found in web templates THEN the system SHALL extract them to appropriate external CSS files
3. WHEN styles are moved THEN the system SHALL maintain the same visual appearance and functionality
4. WHEN CSP headers are applied THEN the system SHALL NOT generate style-src violations for web templates
5. WHEN email templates are processed THEN the system SHALL preserve inline CSS for email client compatibility

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a systematic approach to CSS organization, so that styles are maintainable and follow security best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing CSS files THEN the system SHALL group styles by template or functionality
2. WHEN creating CSS files THEN the system SHALL follow existing naming conventions
3. WHEN styles are extracted THEN the system SHALL use semantic class names
4. WHEN CSS files are created THEN the system SHALL include proper copyright headers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a web application user, I want the visual appearance to remain unchanged, so that the user experience is not affected by the security improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN inline styles are removed THEN the visual layout SHALL remain identical
2. WHEN external CSS is loaded THEN responsive behavior SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN styles are applied THEN interactive elements SHALL maintain their functionality
4. WHEN pages load THEN there SHALL be no visual flickering or layout shifts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive testing of the CSS changes, so that I can be confident the security improvements don't break functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSS changes are made THEN automated tests SHALL verify visual consistency
2. WHEN templates are updated THEN manual testing SHALL confirm functionality
3. WHEN CSP is enabled THEN browser console SHALL show no security violations
4. WHEN changes are deployed THEN rollback procedures SHALL be available

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a maintenance developer, I want clear documentation of the CSS organization, so that future changes can be made efficiently and securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSS files are created THEN documentation SHALL explain the organization structure
2. WHEN styles are moved THEN comments SHALL indicate the original template source
3. WHEN new templates are added THEN guidelines SHALL prevent inline CSS usage
4. WHEN CSS is modified THEN version control SHALL track the security improvements
