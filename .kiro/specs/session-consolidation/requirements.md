# Session Management Consolidation Requirements

## Introduction

The current system uses both Flask sessions (secure cookies) and database sessions (UserSession table), creating complexity, potential conflicts, and maintenance overhead. This consolidation will standardize on a single, robust session management approach that eliminates duplication and improves system reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Session Standardization

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to standardize on database sessions as the single session management approach, so that the system has a consistent, auditable, and scalable session handling mechanism.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing database sessions THEN the system SHALL use the UserSession table as the single source of truth for session state
2. WHEN session data is needed THEN it SHALL be retrieved from and stored in the database exclusively
3. WHEN session security is required THEN database sessions SHALL provide audit trails and centralized control
4. WHEN scaling the system THEN database sessions SHALL support multiple application instances sharing session state
5. WHEN migrating from dual sessions THEN Flask session usage SHALL be completely eliminated

### Requirement 2: Unified Session Interface

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single, consistent session management interface, so that I don't need to understand or maintain two different session systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing session data THEN the system SHALL provide a unified API regardless of the underlying storage mechanism
2. WHEN creating sessions THEN the system SHALL use a single method that handles all session initialization
3. WHEN updating session data THEN the system SHALL use consistent methods across all components
4. WHEN validating sessions THEN the system SHALL use a single validation mechanism
5. WHEN cleaning up sessions THEN the system SHALL use a unified cleanup process

### Requirement 3: Flask Session Elimination

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want Flask sessions to be completely removed from the system, so that there is no confusion or conflict between session management approaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN consolidation is complete THEN Flask session usage SHALL be completely eliminated from the codebase
2. WHEN users log in THEN only database sessions SHALL be created and managed
3. WHEN session data is accessed THEN it SHALL come exclusively from the database
4. WHEN Flask session references exist THEN they SHALL be replaced with database session equivalents
5. WHEN the migration is complete THEN no Flask session cookies SHALL be set or used

### Requirement 4: Code Refactoring and Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to be clean and maintainable after consolidation, so that future development is simplified and less error-prone.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN consolidation is complete THEN all duplicate session management code SHALL be removed
2. WHEN session operations are performed THEN they SHALL use the unified session interface
3. WHEN new features are added THEN they SHALL only need to integrate with one session system
4. WHEN debugging session issues THEN there SHALL be a single source of truth for session state
5. WHEN maintaining the system THEN developers SHALL only need to understand one session approach

### Requirement 5: Performance and Security Maintenance

**User Story:** As a user, I want the consolidated session system to maintain or improve current performance and security levels, so that my experience is not degraded.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sessions are accessed THEN performance SHALL be equal to or better than the current system
2. WHEN session security is evaluated THEN it SHALL meet or exceed current security standards
3. WHEN cross-tab synchronization occurs THEN it SHALL continue to work seamlessly
4. WHEN session validation happens THEN it SHALL be as fast or faster than current implementation
5. WHEN session cleanup runs THEN it SHALL be efficient and not impact user experience

### Requirement 6: Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing of the consolidated session system, so that I can ensure reliability and catch any regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN consolidation is implemented THEN all existing session tests SHALL pass with the new system
2. WHEN new session functionality is added THEN it SHALL have comprehensive test coverage
3. WHEN edge cases are tested THEN the consolidated system SHALL handle them gracefully
4. WHEN load testing is performed THEN the system SHALL perform as well as or better than before
5. WHEN integration testing is done THEN all session-dependent features SHALL work correctly

### Requirement 7: Documentation and Developer Experience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation for the consolidated session system, so that I can effectively work with and maintain the session management code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developers need to work with sessions THEN they SHALL have clear, up-to-date documentation
2. WHEN troubleshooting session issues THEN diagnostic information SHALL be easily accessible
3. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN they SHALL only need to learn one session system
4. WHEN implementing session-aware features THEN examples and patterns SHALL be available
5. WHEN session configuration is needed THEN it SHALL be well-documented and straightforward

### Requirement 8: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want visibility into the consolidated session system's health and performance, so that I can maintain system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring session health THEN metrics SHALL be available for the unified system
2. WHEN session errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient detail for debugging
3. WHEN performance issues arise THEN diagnostic information SHALL be available
4. WHEN system health is checked THEN session management SHALL report its status accurately
5. WHEN alerts are needed THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate notifications for session is
