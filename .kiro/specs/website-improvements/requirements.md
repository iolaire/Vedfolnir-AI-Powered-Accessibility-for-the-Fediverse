# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical website issues identified through comprehensive testing, including missing admin routes, security vulnerabilities, accessibility problems, and user experience issues. The implementation will focus on fixing broken functionality, improving security compliance, and enhancing the overall user experience across the Vedfolnir web application. All improvements must use and enhance existing system management frameworks rather than creating new ones, ensuring consistency and maintainability. Additionally, this feature will consolidate all frameworks into proper `app/` directory structure and achieve a clean root directory organization.

2. WHEN session synchronization fails THEN the existing session management system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
3. WHEN the session state API encounters errors THEN the existing session framework SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
4. WHEN Redis session storage is unavailable THEN the existing session system SHALL fall back to database sessions gracefully
5. WHEN cross-tab synchronization fails THEN the existing session framework SHALL ensure individual tabs continue to function independently
6. WHEN session improvements are made THEN the existing session management framework SHALL be enhanced, not replaced
7. WHEN session enhancements are implemented THEN steering documents SHALL be updated to enforce use of the single session framework

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user encountering errors, I want clear, helpful error messages and proper error pages, so that I understand what went wrong and how to proceed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a 404 error occurs THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error page with navigation options
2. WHEN JavaScript errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
3. WHEN API endpoints fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages to users
4. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL maintain user session and provide recovery options
5. WHEN errors are logged THEN the system SHALL include sufficient context for effective debugging

### Requirement 7: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user accessing admin interfaces, I want pages to load quickly and efficiently, so that I can perform administrative tasks without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the admin dashboard loads THEN the page SHALL complete loading within 500ms
2. WHEN admin pages are accessed THEN static resources SHALL be properly cached
3. WHEN heavy components are loaded THEN the system SHALL implement lazy loading where appropriate
