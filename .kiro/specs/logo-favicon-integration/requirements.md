# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on properly integrating the existing logo and favicon assets into the Vedfolnir web application to create a cohesive brand identity and improve user experience. The application currently has a complete set of favicon files and a logo image, but they are not fully integrated into the web interface design.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user visiting the web application, I want to see consistent branding with proper favicon display across all browsers and devices, so that I can easily identify the application in browser tabs and bookmarks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits any page of the web application THEN the browser SHALL display the appropriate favicon in the browser tab
2. WHEN a user bookmarks the application THEN the bookmark SHALL display the favicon icon
3. WHEN the application is viewed on mobile devices THEN the appropriate touch icons SHALL be displayed for home screen shortcuts
4. WHEN the application is accessed on different screen densities THEN the optimal favicon size SHALL be served automatically
5. IF the user's browser supports modern favicon formats THEN the application SHALL serve optimized favicon formats (SVG, WebP)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user navigating the web application, I want to see the Vedfolnir logo prominently displayed in the navigation header, so that I have clear visual branding and can easily return to the home page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views any page of the application THEN the Vedfolnir logo SHALL be displayed in the navigation bar
2. WHEN a user clicks on the logo THEN they SHALL be redirected to the dashboard/home page
3. WHEN the logo is displayed THEN it SHALL maintain proper aspect ratio and be appropriately sized for the navigation bar
4. WHEN the application is viewed on mobile devices THEN the logo SHALL scale appropriately and remain visible
5. IF the logo fails to load THEN a text fallback SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user accessing the application on mobile devices, I want proper Progressive Web App (PWA) manifest integration with the logo and icons, so that I can add the application to my home screen with proper branding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application on a mobile device THEN the web app manifest SHALL include proper icon references
2. WHEN a user adds the application to their home screen THEN the appropriate icon sizes SHALL be used for different devices
3. WHEN the manifest is loaded THEN it SHALL include the correct application name and branding information
4. WHEN different screen densities are encountered THEN the manifest SHALL provide appropriate icon sizes
5. IF the user's device supports maskable icons THEN the manifest SHALL include maskable icon variants

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the application, I want the favicon and logo integration to be maintainable and follow web standards, so that future updates to branding assets are straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN favicon files are updated THEN the HTML head section SHALL automatically reference the new files
2. WHEN the logo image is replaced THEN the navigation bar SHALL display the updated logo without code changes
3. WHEN new favicon sizes are added THEN they SHALL be automatically included in the appropriate meta tags
4. WHEN the application is deployed THEN all favicon and logo assets SHALL be properly cached with appropriate headers
5. IF favicon assets are missing THEN the application SHALL gracefully fallback to default icons

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the logo and favicon integration to follow accessibility best practices, so that I can navigate and identify the application effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN screen readers encounter the logo THEN it SHALL have appropriate alt text describing the application
2. WHEN the logo is used as a navigation element THEN it SHALL have proper ARIA labels
3. WHEN high contrast mode is enabled THEN the logo SHALL remain visible and identifiable
4. WHEN users navigate with keyboard only THEN the logo link SHALL be properly focusable
5. IF the logo contains text THEN it SHALL meet WCAG contrast requirements against the background

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user on slow network connections, I want the logo and favicon assets to load efficiently, so that the application remains responsive and usable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN favicon assets SHALL be optimized for fast loading
2. WHEN the logo is displayed THEN it SHALL be served in an optimized format (WebP with fallbacks)
3. WHEN assets are requested THEN they SHALL include proper caching headers
4. WHEN the logo is large THEN it SHALL be compressed without significant quality loss
5. IF network conditions are poor THEN critical favicon assets SHALL load before non-essential sizes
