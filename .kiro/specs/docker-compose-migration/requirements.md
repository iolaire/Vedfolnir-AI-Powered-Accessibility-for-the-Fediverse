# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for migrating Vedfolnir from macOS hosting to Docker Compose deployment with optimizations for Debian Linux containers. The migration will transition from the current macOS-specific setup (using Homebrew, pyenv, launchd services) to a containerized architecture using python:3.12-slim base images, while retaining all existing technologies and functionality.
