# DetachedInstanceError Fix Requirements

## Introduction

The DetachedInstanceError occurs when SQLAlchemy objects are accessed outside of their database session context. This issue is preventing users from accessing the dashboard and other parts of the web application after login. The system needs to ensure that all database objects remain properly attached to their sessions throughout the request lifecycle.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Object Session Attachment

**User Story:** As a web application user, I want to access the dashboard and other pages without encountering DetachedInstanceError, so that I can use the application normally after logging in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I log in successfully THEN I SHALL be able to access the dashboard without database errors
2. WHEN I navigate between pages THEN database objects SHALL remain accessible throughout the request
3. WHEN the application accesses user or platform objects THEN they SHALL be properly attached to the current database session
4. WHEN database queries are performed THEN the resulting objects SHALL be usable throughout the request lifecycle

### Requirement 2: Current User Context Management

**User Story:** As a Flask application, I want to properly manage the current_user object and its relationships, so that user information and platform context remain accessible throughout request processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN current_user is accessed THEN it SHALL be properly attached to the current database session
2. WHEN current_user.platforms is accessed THEN the relationship SHALL be loaded and accessible
3. WHEN platform switching occurs THEN the current_user object SHALL maintain its session attachment
4. WHEN user authentication is checked THEN the user object SHALL be accessible without DetachedInstanceError

### Requirement 3: Platform Context Session Management

**User Story:** As a user with multiple platforms, I want platform switching and platform-related operations to work without database errors, so that I can manage my different platform connections effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I switch platforms THEN the platform objects SHALL remain accessible after the switch
2. WHEN platform information is displayed THEN the platform objects SHALL be properly loaded from the database
3. WHEN platform relationships are accessed THEN they SHALL be available without session detachment errors
4. WHEN platform operations are performed THEN the database session SHALL maintain object attachment

### Requirement 4: Request-Scoped Session Management

**User Story:** As a Flask application, I want database sessions to be properly scoped to requests, so that objects loaded in one part of the request remain accessible in other parts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request begins THEN a database session SHALL be established and maintained throughout the request
2. WHEN objects are loaded from the database THEN they SHALL remain attached to the session for the entire request
3. WHEN the request ends THEN the database session SHALL be properly closed and cleaned up
4. WHEN multiple database operations occur in a request THEN they SHALL use the same session context

### Requirement 5: Template Context Database Access

**User Story:** As a template rendering system, I want to access database objects and their relationships without encountering DetachedInstanceError, so that user interfaces can display dynamic content properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN templates access current_user properties THEN they SHALL be available without database errors
2. WHEN templates iterate over user relationships THEN the objects SHALL be properly loaded and accessible
3. WHEN template context processors run THEN they SHALL have access to properly attached database objects
4. WHEN template rendering occurs THEN all database objects SHALL remain accessible throughout the rendering process

### Requirement 6: Login Flow Session Continuity

**User Story:** As a user logging into the system, I want the login process to properly establish database session context, so that I can immediately access the application after authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I submit login credentials THEN the authentication process SHALL maintain proper database session context
2. WHEN login succeeds THEN the user object SHALL be properly attached and accessible for subsequent operations
3. WHEN session creation occurs during login THEN all database objects SHALL remain accessible
4. WHEN I am redirected after login THEN the database context SHALL be properly maintained

### Requirement 7: Error Prevention and Recovery

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to prevent DetachedInstanceError and gracefully handle any database session issues, so that users have a reliable experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database session issues occur THEN the system SHALL detect and handle them gracefully
2. WHEN DetachedInstanceError is encountered THEN the system SHALL attempt to recover by reloading objects
3. WHEN session attachment fails THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be displayed to users
4. WHEN database connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful feedback

### Requirement 8: Performance and Efficiency

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious application, I want database session management to be efficient while preventing DetachedInstanceError, so that the application remains responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database objects are accessed multiple times THEN they SHALL be efficiently cached within the session
2. WHEN relationships are loaded THEN they SHALL use appropriate loading strategies to minimize queries
3. WHEN session management occurs THEN it SHALL not significantly impact application performance
4. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL be optimized for both correctness and speed
