# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the existing maintenance mode functionality to provide comprehensive system protection during maintenance operations. Currently, the maintenance mode service only provides basic enable/disable functionality through configuration. This enhancement will implement granular operation blocking, user session management, and comprehensive maintenance workflows to ensure safe maintenance operations.

The enhanced maintenance mode will block specific high-risk operations while allowing safe administrative functions, automatically manage user sessions during maintenance periods, and provide clear feedback to users about maintenance status and expected duration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Caption Generation Blocking

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want caption generation to be completely blocked during maintenance mode, so that no new AI processing jobs are started that could interfere with maintenance operations.

2. WHEN maintenance mode is enabled THEN image optimization tasks SHALL be prevented
3. WHEN maintenance mode is enabled THEN image analysis operations SHALL be disabled
4. WHEN a user attempts image processing during maintenance THEN they SHALL receive maintenance status
5. WHEN maintenance mode is disabled THEN image processing SHALL resume with full functionality

### Requirement 8: Maintenance Mode Middleware

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want maintenance mode checks to be automatically applied across the application, so that I don't have to manually add checks to every endpoint.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN maintenance mode is enabled THEN middleware SHALL automatically check all requests
2. WHEN a blocked operation is attempted THEN middleware SHALL return consistent maintenance responses
3. WHEN admin users access the system THEN middleware SHALL allow administrative operations
4. WHEN maintenance mode status changes THEN middleware SHALL update behavior immediately
5. WHEN middleware detects maintenance mode THEN it SHALL log access attempts for monitoring

### Requirement 9: Maintenance Status API

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want a dedicated API endpoint to check maintenance status, so that the user interface can display appropriate maintenance information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN maintenance status is requested THEN the API SHALL return current maintenance state
2. WHEN maintenance mode is active THEN the API SHALL include maintenance reason and estimated duration
3. WHEN maintenance mode is inactive THEN the API SHALL confirm normal operations
