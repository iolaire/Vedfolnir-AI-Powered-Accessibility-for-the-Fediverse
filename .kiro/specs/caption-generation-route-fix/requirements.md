# Caption Generation Route Fix - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The caption generation route (`/caption_generation`) is currently failing with redirect errors and not properly integrating with the current session and platform management system. Users are unable to access the caption generation page, receiving "Error loading caption generation page" messages and being redirected to the dashboard. This issue prevents users from accessing a core feature of the application.

**Note:** WebSocket errors in the logs should be ignored as they are being addressed in the separate Notification System Migration project.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Route Access and Platform Integration

**User Story:** As a user with an active platform connection, I want to access the caption generation page so that I can generate captions for my posts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to `/caption_generation` THEN the system SHALL load the page successfully without redirects
2. WHEN a user has an active platform connection THEN the system SHALL recognize and display the current platform context
3. WHEN a user has multiple platform connections THEN the system SHALL use the currently selected platform from the session
4. IF a user has no platform connections THEN the system SHALL redirect to platform setup with an appropriate message
5. IF a user has platform connections but no active selection THEN the system SHALL redirect to platform management with guidance

### Requirement 2: Session Management Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the caption generation page to use the current session and platform management system so that my platform selection is consistent across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the caption generation page THEN the system SHALL use the Redis session manager for session data
2. WHEN retrieving platform context THEN the system SHALL use `get_current_session_context()` from the session middleware
3. WHEN performing database operations THEN the system SHALL use `db_manager.get_session()` instead of legacy session managers
4. WHEN the platform context is available THEN the system SHALL display the same platform information shown on other pages
5. WHEN session data is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency with other application components

### Requirement 3: Error Handling and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when there are issues accessing the caption generation page so that I can understand what action to take.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN there are platform connection issues THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages
2. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without exposing technical details
3. WHEN session context is missing THEN the system SHALL guide users to the appropriate setup page
4. WHEN the page loads successfully THEN the system SHALL display the current platform name and connection status
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging while showing user-friendly messages

### Requirement 4: Decorator and Security Consistency

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the caption generation route to follow the same security and access patterns as other platform-dependent routes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining the caption generation route THEN the system SHALL include the `@platform_required` decorator
2. WHEN a user accesses the route THEN the system SHALL validate authentication and platform access consistently
3. WHEN platform validation fails THEN the system SHALL redirect using the same patterns as other routes
4. WHEN the route is accessed THEN the system SHALL apply the same rate limiting and security measures
5. WHEN session validation occurs THEN the system SHALL use the current session management architecture

### Requirement 5: Template Context and Data Consistency

**User Story:** As a user, I want the caption generation page to display the same platform information and user context as other pages in the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page renders THEN the system SHALL provide platform context data to the template
2. WHEN displaying platform information THEN the system SHALL show the same platform name and details as the dashboard
3. WHEN loading user settings THEN the system SHALL retrieve settings for the currently active platform
4. WHEN the template context is populated THEN the system SHALL include all necessary data for proper page rendering
5. WHEN platform switching occurs THEN the system SHALL reflect changes immediately on the caption generation page

### Requirement 6: Database Operation Modernization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the caption generation route to use the current database patterns for optimal performance and consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing database queries THEN the system SHALL use `db_manager.get_session()` context managers
2. WHEN accessing user settings THEN the system SHALL follow the current database access patterns
3. WHEN handling database errors THEN the system SHALL use proper exception handling and cleanup
4. WHEN multiple database operations occur THEN the system SHALL manage transactions appropriately
5. WHEN the route completes THEN the system SHALL ensure proper resource cleanup and connection management
