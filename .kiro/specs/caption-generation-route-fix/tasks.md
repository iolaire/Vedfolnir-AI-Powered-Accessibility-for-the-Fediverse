# Implementation Plan


**** this should be fixed tast 6 was what we wanted to resolve
- [x] 1. Add platform_required decorator to caption_generation route
  - Add `@platform_required` decorator to the route decorator stack
  - Ensure proper import of the decorator
  - Test that platform validation works correctly
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 1.5, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 2. Update database access patterns to use db_manager
  - Replace `unified_session_manager.get_db_session()` with `db_manager.get_session()`
  - Update all database query patterns in the route
  - Implement proper error handling for database operations
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 6.1, 6.2, 6.4, 6.5_

- [x] 3. Integrate current session context management
  - Use `get_current_session_context()` for platform context retrieval
  - Remove manual platform context detection code
  - Ensure consistency with other routes using session context
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 4. Implement proper error handling and user feedback
  - Add specific error messages for different failure scenarios
  - Implement graceful fallback for Redis/database errors
  - Ensure error logging follows security guidelines (sanitize_for_log)
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.5_

- [x] 5. Update template context to use global context processor data
  - Remove redundant platform data retrieval since global context processor provides it
  - Ensure template receives consistent platform information
  - Verify platform switching reflects immediately on the page
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [x] 6. Fix "maximum recursion depth exceeded" error in caption generation template
  - Debug and identify the source of the recursion error in template rendering
  - Check for circular references in template context variables
  - Investigate template inheritance chain for potential loops
  - Fix any recursive template includes or context processor issues
  - Ensure caption generation page renders properly with "Start Caption Generation" text
  - Test template rendering with different user and platform contexts
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 5.1, 5.2_

- [ ] 7. Investigate and fix login route platform data copy execution
  - Debug why the login route is not executing the platform data copy code
  - Add comprehensive logging to track the login route execution flow
  - Identify any early returns, exceptions, or control flow issues preventing execution
  - Ensure platform data synchronization runs after successful Redis session creation
  - Verify platform context transfers from Redis session to Flask session during login
  - Test that @platform_required decorator works after login with proper platform context
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.5, 3.3_

- [ ] 8. Fix session platform context persistence issue
  - Investigate why browser sessions don't maintain platform_connection_id consistently
  - Ensure platform context is properly set and persisted across requests
  - Ensure platform context is properly set and persisted on caption generation page
  - Verify session middleware correctly populates g.session_context with platform data
  - Test that platform selection in platform management properly updates session context
  - Ensure @platform_required decorator can access platform context from get_current_session_context()
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.5, 3.3_

- [ ] 9. Test route functionality with different user scenarios
  - Test with authenticated user having no platform connections
  - Test with authenticated user having single platform but no active selection
  - Test with authenticated user having active platform connection
  - Test with authenticated user having no platform connections
  - Test with authenticated user having multiple platforms but no active selection
  - Test error scenarios and proper redirect behavior
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 3.4_

- [ ] 10. Verify consistency with other platform-dependent routes
  - Compare decorator stack with other routes (review, platform_management)
  - Ensure error handling patterns match other routes
  - Verify security measures are consistently applied
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [ ] 11. Update user settings retrieval to follow current patterns
  - Implement Redis-first, database-fallback pattern for user settings
  - Use proper error handling for settings retrieval
  - Ensure settings are retrieved for the correct platform context
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 5.3, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_
