# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the need to audit and improve CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) token implementation across all templates in the Vedfolnir application. The current implementation has inconsistencies and potential security vulnerabilities that need to be addressed to ensure proper CSRF protection while maintaining usability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: CSRF Token Consistency

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want all forms to have consistent CSRF protection, so that the application is protected against CSRF attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a form is submitted via POST THEN the system SHALL validate a CSRF token
2. WHEN a form is rendered THEN the system SHALL include a hidden CSRF token field
3. WHEN an AJAX request is made THEN the system SHALL include the CSRF token in the request headers
4. WHEN a GET form is used for filtering THEN the system SHALL NOT require CSRF tokens (as GET requests should be idempotent)

### Requirement 2: CSRF Token Visibility Security

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want CSRF tokens to be properly hidden from HTML source inspection, so that tokens cannot be easily extracted by malicious scripts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a CSRF token is included in a form THEN it SHALL be in a hidden input field
2. WHEN a CSRF token is included in meta tags THEN it SHALL only be accessible via JavaScript for legitimate AJAX requests
3. WHEN viewing page source THEN CSRF tokens SHALL NOT be visible in comments or visible text
4. WHEN CSRF tokens are logged THEN they SHALL be sanitized or masked in log files

### Requirement 3: CSRF Token Validation

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want all CSRF tokens to be properly validated on the server side, so that invalid or missing tokens are rejected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is received without a valid CSRF token THEN the system SHALL return a 403 Forbidden error
2. WHEN a CSRF token is expired THEN the system SHALL reject the request and prompt for re-authentication
3. WHEN a CSRF token is reused THEN the system SHALL validate it according to Flask-WTF security policies
4. WHEN CSRF validation fails THEN the system SHALL log the security event for monitoring

### Requirement 4: AJAX CSRF Protection

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all AJAX requests to include proper CSRF protection, so that dynamic functionality is secure against CSRF attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AJAX request is made THEN it SHALL include the X-CSRFToken header
2. WHEN the CSRF token is retrieved for AJAX THEN it SHALL be obtained from the meta tag
3. WHEN an AJAX request fails CSRF validation THEN the system SHALL return a proper error response
4. WHEN CSRF tokens are refreshed THEN AJAX functionality SHALL continue to work without page reload

### Requirement 5: Form Security Audit

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want all forms audited for CSRF protection, so that no forms are left vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auditing forms THEN all POST forms SHALL have CSRF protection
2. WHEN auditing forms THEN GET forms used for filtering SHALL NOT have CSRF tokens
3. WHEN auditing forms THEN modal forms SHALL have proper CSRF protection
4. WHEN auditing forms THEN dynamically generated forms SHALL include CSRF tokens

### Requirement 6: CSRF Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages when CSRF validation fails, so that I understand what went wrong and how to proceed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSRF validation fails THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN CSRF validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on how to retry the action
3. WHEN CSRF validation fails THEN the system SHALL preserve form data where possible
4. WHEN CSRF validation fails THEN the system SHALL log the security event without exposing sensitive information

### Requirement 7: CSRF Configuration Security

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want CSRF protection to be properly configured, so that the security settings are appropriate for the production environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN CSRF protection SHALL be enabled by default
2. WHEN CSRF tokens are generated THEN they SHALL have sufficient entropy and randomness
3. WHEN CSRF tokens expire THEN the expiration time SHALL be configurable and secure
4. WHEN CSRF protection is configured THEN it SHALL integrate with the existing security framework

### Requirement 8: Template Security Standards

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent template security standards, so that all templates follow the same CSRF protection patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new templates THEN they SHALL follow the established CSRF protection patterns
2. WHEN updating existing templates THEN CSRF protection SHALL be reviewed and updated if necessary
3. WHEN using template inheritance THEN CSRF protection SHALL be properly inherited
4. WHEN including template fragments THEN CSRF protection SHALL be maintained across includes
