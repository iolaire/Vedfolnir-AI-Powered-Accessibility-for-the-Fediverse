# Session Management System Requirements

## Introduction

The Session Management System provides robust, secure, and synchronized session handling across multiple browser tabs and platform contexts. This system ensures consistent user experience, prevents data conflicts, and maintains session integrity throughout the application lifecycle.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Session Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper database session lifecycle management, so that the application doesn't suffer from memory leaks or connection pool exhaustion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a database operation is performed THEN the system SHALL use a context manager pattern to ensure proper session cleanup
2. WHEN a database error occurs THEN the system SHALL automatically rollback the transaction and close the session
3. WHEN multiple database operations are performed concurrently THEN the system SHALL prevent session conflicts through proper isolation
4. WHEN the application is under load THEN the system SHALL efficiently manage database connection pool resources

### Requirement 2: Cross-Tab Session Synchronization

**User Story:** As a user, I want my session state to be consistent across all browser tabs, so that I don't experience conflicts or inconsistent behavior when using multiple tabs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I switch platforms in one tab THEN all other tabs SHALL automatically update to reflect the new platform context
2. WHEN my session expires THEN all tabs SHALL be notified and redirect to the login page
3. WHEN I log out from one tab THEN all other tabs SHALL immediately reflect the logout state
4. WHEN I open a new tab THEN it SHALL automatically sync with the current session state from existing tabs
5. WHEN session state changes occur THEN the synchronization SHALL happen within 2 seconds across all tabs

### Requirement 3: Platform Switching Race Condition Prevention

**User Story:** As a user, I want platform switching to work reliably even when I click rapidly or use multiple tabs, so that I don't experience conflicts or inconsistent platform states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I attempt to switch platforms multiple times rapidly THEN only the first request SHALL be processed and subsequent requests SHALL be ignored
2. WHEN a platform switch is in progress THEN the UI SHALL provide visual feedback indicating the operation is ongoing
3. WHEN a platform switch fails THEN the UI SHALL revert to the previous state and display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN I switch platforms in one tab THEN other tabs SHALL be notified and update their UI accordingly
5. WHEN multiple tabs attempt to switch platforms simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle the requests without conflicts

### Requirement 4: Session State API

**User Story:** As a frontend application, I want access to current session state information, so that I can synchronize UI components and validate session integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request session state THEN the API SHALL return current user information, platform context, and session metadata
2. WHEN I am not authenticated THEN the session state API SHALL return appropriate authentication error
3. WHEN no platform is selected THEN the API SHALL return user information with null platform context
4. WHEN the session is invalid THEN the API SHALL return appropriate error status
5. WHEN I request session state THEN the response SHALL include a timestamp for synchronization purposes

### Requirement 5: Session Security and Validation

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my session to be secure and properly validated, so that unauthorized access is prevented and session integrity is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN my session expires THEN I SHALL be automatically logged out and redirected to the login page
2. WHEN session data is transmitted between tabs THEN only non-sensitive information SHALL be shared via localStorage
3. WHEN I perform sensitive operations THEN CSRF protection SHALL be maintained
4. WHEN my session is compromised THEN the system SHALL invalidate all related sessions
5. WHEN I access the application from a new device THEN proper authentication SHALL be required

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when session-related operations fail, so that I understand what happened and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a session operation fails THEN I SHALL receive a clear, user-friendly error message
2. WHEN a platform switch fails THEN the UI SHALL revert to the previous state with an error notification
3. WHEN my session expires THEN I SHALL receive a notification before being redirected to login
4. WHEN cross-tab synchronization fails THEN the affected tabs SHALL display appropriate warnings
5. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide offline-friendly error messages

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a user, I want session operations to be fast and responsive, so that the application feels smooth and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I switch platforms THEN the UI SHALL update optimistically within 100ms
2. WHEN cross-tab synchronization occurs THEN it SHALL not impact the responsiveness of individual tabs
3. WHEN multiple users are active THEN the session management system SHALL scale efficiently
4. WHEN database operations are performed THEN connection pooling SHALL be optimized for performance
5. WHEN session validation occurs THEN it SHALL be performed efficiently without blocking user interactions

### Requirement 8: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want visibility into session management performance and issues, so that I can maintain system health and troubleshoot problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN session operations occur THEN relevant metrics SHALL be logged for monitoring
2. WHEN session errors occur THEN detailed error information SHALL be logged for debugging
3. WHEN performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information
4. WHEN unusual session patterns are detected THEN appropriate alerts SHALL be generated
5. WHEN system health checks are performed THEN session management components SHALL report their status
