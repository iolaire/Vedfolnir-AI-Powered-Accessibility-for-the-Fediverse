# Notification System Migration Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses the need to migrate all user and admin pages from legacy notification systems to the standardized WebSocket CORS framework established in `.kiro/specs/websocket-cors-standardization`. The goal is to implement a unified notification system across the entire application, ensuring consistent real-time messaging, proper error handling, and seamless user experience for both regular users and administrators.  8/29/2025

1. WHEN on the main dashboard THEN the system SHALL display real-time notifications using the standardized WebSocket framework
2. WHEN processing captions THEN the system SHALL show progress updates through the unified notification system
3. WHEN platform operations occur THEN the system SHALL notify users of success, errors, or status changes in real-time
4. WHEN system maintenance occurs THEN the system SHALL display maintenance notifications consistently across all user pages
5. WHEN notification delivery fails THEN the system SHALL use fallback mechanisms to ensure users receive important messages

### Requirement 4: Admin Interface Notification Migration

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to receive real-time notifications on all admin pages, so that I can monitor system status and respond to issues promptly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN on the admin dashboard THEN the system SHALL display real-time system health notifications using the standardized framework
2. WHEN managing users THEN the system SHALL show real-time updates about user operations and status changes
3. WHEN monitoring system performance THEN the system SHALL provide real-time metrics and alerts through the unified notification system
4. WHEN system maintenance operations occur THEN the system SHALL display detailed progress and status updates to administrators
5. WHEN critical system events occur THEN the system SHALL ensure administrators receive immediate notifications with appropriate priority

### Requirement 5: Cross-Page Notification Consistency

**User Story:** As a user, I want notifications to appear consistently across all pages, so that the interface behavior is predictable and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN notifications are displayed THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling, positioning, and behavior across all pages
2. WHEN notification types vary THEN the system SHALL apply consistent visual indicators for success, warning, error, and info messages
3. WHEN notifications have different priorities THEN the system SHALL display them with appropriate visual hierarchy and timing
4. WHEN users interact with notifications THEN the system SHALL provide consistent dismiss, action, and persistence behaviors
5. WHEN notifications stack or queue THEN the system SHALL manage display order and limits consistently across all pages

### Requirement 6: Real-Time Message Delivery Standardization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all real-time messages to use the same delivery mechanism, so that message routing and delivery is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending notifications THEN the system SHALL use the standardized WebSocket message format established in the CORS framework
2. WHEN targeting specific users THEN the system SHALL route messages through the appropriate WebSocket namespaces and rooms
3. WHEN delivering admin-specific messages THEN the system SHALL ensure only authorized administrators receive sensitive notifications
4. WHEN message delivery fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic and fallback notification mechanisms
5. WHEN messages require persistence THEN the system SHALL store and replay messages for users who reconnect after disconnection

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Recovery Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the notification system to work reliably even when network conditions are poor, so that I don't miss important updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WebSocket connections fail THEN the system SHALL use the standardized error recovery mechanisms from the CORS framework
2. WHEN CORS issues occur THEN the system SHALL detect and resolve them using the established CORS management system
3. WHEN authentication failures happen THEN the system SHALL handle re-authentication seamlessly without losing notification context
4. WHEN network connectivity is intermittent THEN the system SHALL queue notifications and deliver them when connection is restored
5. WHEN error recovery succeeds THEN the system SHALL restore notification functionality without requiring page refresh

### Requirement 8: Authentication and Authorization Integration

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want the notification system to respect user roles and permissions, so that sensitive information is only delivered to authorized users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN establishing WebSocket connections THEN the system SHALL authenticate users using the existing session management system
2. WHEN joining notification channels THEN the system SHALL verify user permissions for the requested notification types
3. WHEN admin notifications are sent THEN the system SHALL ensure only users with admin roles receive administrative messages
4. WHEN user context changes THEN the system SHALL update notification subscriptions to match current permissions
5. WHEN security violations are detected THEN the system SHALL log security events and disconnect unauthorized connections

### Requirement 9: Performance and Scalability Optimization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the notification system to perform efficiently across all pages, so that real-time features don't impact overall application performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple pages are open THEN the system SHALL efficiently manage WebSocket connections without creating excessive overhead
2. WHEN broadcasting notifications THEN the system SHALL optimize message delivery to minimize bandwidth and processing requirements
3. WHEN handling high notification volumes THEN the system SHALL implement batching and throttling to maintain performance
4. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade notification features while maintaining core functionality
5. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL track notification system metrics and provide alerts for performance issues

### Requirement 10: Testing and Validation Framework

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing for the migrated notification system, so that I can ensure all pages work correctly with the new framework.
