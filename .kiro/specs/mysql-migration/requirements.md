# Requirements Document: Complete SQLite to MySQL Migration

## Introduction

This specification outlines the completion of the SQLite to MySQL migration for the Vedfolnir application. Based on analysis of the current codebase, partial MySQL migration infrastructure exists but SQLite is still the default database. This specification will complete the migration and remove all SQLite dependencies without preserving existing SQLite data.

## Current State Analysis

- MySQL migration scripts exist in `/scripts/mysql_migration/`
- Database manager supports both SQLite and MySQL configurations
- Default configuration still uses SQLite (`sqlite:///storage/database/vedfolnir.db`)
- Extensive SQLite references throughout codebase (50+ files)
- Redis is properly configured for session management

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Database Configuration Migration
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want MySQL to be the default and only database backend so that the application runs with production-ready database infrastructure.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN the application starts THE SYSTEM SHALL use MySQL as the default database connection
2. WHEN DATABASE_URL is not specified THE SYSTEM SHALL default to MySQL configuration
3. WHEN SQLite configuration is encountered THE SYSTEM SHALL log deprecation warnings and fail gracefully
4. WHEN MySQL connection fails THE SYSTEM SHALL provide clear error messages with connection troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 2: SQLite Code Removal and Cleanup
**User Story:** As a developer, I want all SQLite-specific code removed so that the codebase is clean and maintainable without legacy dependencies.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN code cleanup occurs THE SYSTEM SHALL remove all SQLite import statements and connection logic
2. WHEN configuration is updated THE SYSTEM SHALL remove SQLite-specific configuration options and defaults
3. WHEN database manager is refactored THE SYSTEM SHALL contain only MySQL connection and optimization logic
4. WHEN tests are updated THE SYSTEM SHALL use MySQL test databases exclusively

### Requirement 3: Test Suite Migration and Validation
**User Story:** As a developer, I want all tests to run against MySQL so that database functionality is validated against the production database backend.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN test suite runs THE SYSTEM SHALL execute all database tests against MySQL test instances
2. WHEN test fixtures are created THE SYSTEM SHALL use MySQL-compatible data types and constraints
3. WHEN performance tests execute THE SYSTEM SHALL measure MySQL-specific performance characteristics
4. WHEN integration tests run THE SYSTEM SHALL validate MySQL connection pooling and optimization features

### Requirement 4: Documentation and Configuration Updates
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want updated documentation and configuration examples so that MySQL setup and deployment procedures are clear and complete.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN documentation is updated THE SYSTEM SHALL provide MySQL installation, configuration, and optimization guides
2. WHEN environment examples are provided THE SYSTEM SHALL include MySQL connection strings and configuration options
3. WHEN deployment guides are updated THE SYSTEM SHALL remove all SQLite references and include MySQL-specific procedures
4. WHEN troubleshooting documentation is revised THE SYSTEM SHALL include MySQL-specific diagnostic and performance tuning information

### Requirement 5: Performance Optimization and MySQL Features
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the MySQL implementation to leverage MySQL-specific features so that database performance is optimized for production workloads.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN database connections are established THE SYSTEM SHALL use MySQL connection pooling with optimized parameters
2. WHEN queries are executed THE SYSTEM SHALL use MySQL-specific index types and query optimizations
3. WHEN database schema is created THE SYSTEM SHALL use MySQL-appropriate data types and storage engines
4. WHEN performance monitoring is active THE SYSTEM SHALL track MySQL-specific performance metrics

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Recovery Enhancement
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust error handling for MySQL operations so that database issues can be diagnosed and resolved effectively.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN MySQL connection errors occur THE SYSTEM SHALL provide specific error messages with connection parameter validation
2. WHEN query errors happen THE SYSTEM SHALL log MySQL-specific error codes and suggested resolutions
3. WHEN connection pool exhaustion occurs THE SYSTEM SHALL implement graceful degradation and recovery mechanisms
4. WHEN database maintenance is needed THE SYSTEM SHALL provide MySQL-specific maintenance and optimization recommendations

### Requirement 7: Environment Configuration Standardization
**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized MySQL environment configuration so that development, testing, and production environments use consistent database setup.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN environment variables are loaded THE SYSTEM SHALL validate MySQL connection parameters and provide clear error messages for missing or invalid values
2. WHEN different environments are configured THE SYSTEM SHALL support MySQL connection strings with SSL, connection pooling, and charset options
3. WHEN configuration validation runs THE SYSTEM SHALL verify MySQL server compatibility and feature availability
4. WHEN deployment occurs THE SYSTEM SHALL automatically configure MySQL-specific optimizations based on environment type

### Requirement 8: Legacy SQLite File Cleanup and Archival
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want existing SQLite files properly removed so that disk space is reclaimed and legacy files don't cause confusion.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN cleanup occurs THE SYSTEM SHALL remove SQLite database files, WAL files, and SHM files from storage directories
2. WHEN SQLite files are removed THE SYSTEM SHALL log the cleanup process for audit purposes
3. WHEN storage cleanup runs THE SYSTEM SHALL identify and remove all SQLite-related temporary and backup files
4. WHEN file removal completes THE SYSTEM SHALL verify that no SQLite database files remain in the application directory structure
