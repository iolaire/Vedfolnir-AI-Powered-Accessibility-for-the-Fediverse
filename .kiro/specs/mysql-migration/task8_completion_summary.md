python tests/integration/test_mysql_performance_integration.py

# Run all integration tests with MySQL
python -m pytest tests/integration/ -v

# Run performance test suite
python -c "
from tests.mysql_test_base import MySQLIntegrationTestBase
from tests.mysql_performance_testing import MySQLPerformanceTester
# Performance testing code here
"
```

### Using MySQL Performance Testing in Integration Tests:
```python
from tests.mysql_test_base import MySQLIntegrationTestBase

class MyIntegrationTest(MySQLIntegrationTestBase):
    def test_mysql_performance(self):
        # Test connection pooling
        self.test_mysql_connection_pooling()
        
        # Test query performance
        self.test_mysql_query_performance()
        
        # Test optimization features
        self.test_mysql_optimization_features()
        
        # Run comprehensive performance suite
        results = self.run_performance_test_suite()
        
        # Assert performance thresholds
        self.assert_performance_threshold("average_connection_time", 0.5, results)
```

## Next Steps
